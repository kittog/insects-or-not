Symphylan
[[File:Scutigerella_immaculata_(male).jpg|thumb|''[[Scutigerella immaculata]]'']]'''Symphylans''' are [[myriapod]]s that somewhat resemble silk worms and do indeed make silk. They are commonly known to people with gardens, because they can be small pests. There are only two [[family|families]] of symphylans and only 175 species. 

== Anatomy ==
Symphylans are [[worm|worm-like]] and resemble [[millipede]]s a lot. A symphylan's head has two [[antenna|antennae]] and has no eyes. The trunk of a symphylan is made up of 14 segments. In the last trunk segment is a pair of [[spinneret]]s that do resemble [[cerci]]. The bodies of symphylans are white or pale gray, and are squishy. 

== Life Cycle ==
The males leave a [[spermatophore]] on the ground, and the females use their mouths to scoop them up. The females use mouthparts to remove eggs from their genital opening and then smears the sperm on them from the spermatophore. About 30 [[egg]]s are laid at a time. Once the young hatch, they will have on 12 legs (an adult has 24 legs) and will then gain additional segments and legs during each molt. Certain species are able to live 3 or 4 years!

== Defense ==
Symphylans are fast and flexible, making them be able to run away in time before their predator kills them. 

== Feeding ==
All symphylans are [[herbivorous]], eating off of roots and leaves, making it a greenhouse pest. 

== Geography ==
Symphylans live worldwide in soil and leaf litter in a variety of habitats.
