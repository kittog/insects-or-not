Dolomedes minor
[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]The '''nursery web spider''' (''Dolomedes minor'') is a [[spider]] indigenous to New Zealand.
==Identification==
''Dolomedes minor'' is pale brown with some being grayish, like the rocks around which they live, helping to camouflage them against predators. (Arnqvist, 1992) The spider has large pedipalps, which are usually used for sensory purposes. The palps in the male ''Dolomedes minor'' are modified for putting sperm into the female's epigyne, which is located on the underside of the female's abdomen. The female ''Dolomedes minor'' can easily be identified based on this location of the epigyne. They possess large chelicerae, which are located just below the eyes. (Andrews, 1986) The spider has a body length of about 18 mm. The females are almost twice the size of the males. They move very fast and possess a long leg-span: over sixty millimeters for a fully grown female.
==Natural global range==
The family Pisauridae, containing all nursery web spiders, has been estimated to contain over 300 species. However, ''Dolomedes minor'' is the only species endemic to New Zealand.
