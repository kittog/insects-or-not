Araneus diadematus
[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]The [[spider]] species '''''Araneus diadematus''''' is commonly called the ''European garden spider'', ''diadem spider'', ''cross spider'', or ''crowned orb weaver''. It is an [[orb-weaver spider]] found in Europe and North America.
==Range==
''A. diadematus'' is found throughout Europe and across North America, from southern Canada to Mexico, and from British Columbia to Newfoundland.
==Size and markings==
Individual spiders' colourings can range from extremely light yellow to very dark grey, but all ''A. diadematus'' have mottled white markings across the dorsal abdomen, with four or more segments forming a cross. The markings are formed in cells filled with guanine, which is a byproduct of protein metabolism.[5]

Adult females range in length from 6.5 to 20 mm (0.26 to 0.79 in), while males range from 5.5 to 13 mm (0.22 to 0.51 in).[6] Occasionally, the female will eat the male directly after mating. (See video below.)
