Hellgramite
Ecological Role - '''Hellgrammites''' are voracious predators that live underneath submerged rocks and logs. They will capture and eat any creature smaller than themselves, especially mayfly and stonefly nymphs, small crayfish, and other invertebrates.[[File:Lithobius forficatus.jpg|thumb|A hellgrammite, indeed.]]

== Life Cycle ==
After spending one to 14 days inside the cell as a pre[[pupa]], the '''hellgrammite''' sheds its exoskeleton to '''become''' a pupa. The pupal stage requires seven to 14 days after which the adult emerges and digs its way out of the cell. Adult [[Dobsonfly|dobsonflies]] are short-lived (about three days for males and eight to 10 days for females).
