Giant Laotian harvestman
[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]The '''giant Laotian harvestman''' is the unofficial name for an as-yet undescribed species of [[Opiliones]] belonging to the family Sclerosomatidae. The species was discovered in April 2012 near a cave in the southern province of Khammouan, by Dr. Peter JÃ¤ger of the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, Germany, whilst shooting a television documentary about the wildlife of Laos.

==Physical description==
The giant Laotian harvestman dwells inside the caves of Laos, and has a leg span stretching just over 330 millimeters (13 inches), thus making it the second largest harvestman discovered so far - surpassed only by another species in South America. It is currently unknown why it has such a large leg span, but it is believed that, since opiliones breathe[clarification needed] through their legs, a larger leg span makes respiration easier in the caves' low oxygen environment.

==Predators==
Predators of the giant Laotian harvestman most likely include the larger but not as lengthy [[giant huntsman spider]] (''Heteropoda maxima''), ''Thereuopoda longicornis'',[2] other larger arthropods in terms of body mass - such as other predatory [[centipede]]s, [[huntsman spider]]s and larger arachnids - and small cave mammals.
