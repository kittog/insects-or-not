''Gluvia dorsalis'' , also known as the '''Iberian solifuge or European Solifugid''' is the only [[sun-spider]] that is inhabitant to Portugal and Spain,. It belongs to the monotypic genus [[Gluvia]]. 

== Morphology ==
Gluvia dorsalis reaches about 2.2 inches on average, they possess a copper-coloured prosoma, Opisthosoma is glossy, burnished-black, they possess razor-sharp chelicerae. The pedipalps are greatly enlarged and darken distally. Small bristles sit over their bodies, essentialls for receiving stimuli. The pedipalps of Gluvia dorsalis are longer than the first two pairs of legs. 

== Ecology ==

=== Life history ===
Gluvia dorsalis is a biennial species with reproduction occurring during June. The eggs are laid 11 days after fertilisation Gluvia dorsalis is ovoviviparous the females perish shortly after oviposition. About 84 eggs on average are laid in a burrow. Larvae are born after 56 days and do not feed for another 17 days, followed by the occurrence of their first molt. Infants reach sexual maturity 7-8 months on average. The infants burrow themselves during molting so, as to let their new exoskeleton harden. The prime activities occur from May till November which is followed by a hibernation. During hibernation the species remains inside it’s burrow.

=== Hunting ===

Gluvia dorsalis is a strictly nocturnal species. Known for their agility, the species scuttles around at an erratic pace stopping from time to time. The prey is snatched and crushed with the help of their strong chelicerae.[[File:Gluvia_dorsalis.jpg|thumb]]

==== Feeding ====
Gluvia dorsalis is strictly predacious with ants forming a major part of it’s diet, Gluvia dorsalis are also known to feed off spiders, isopods and scale insects.

== Geographical distribution ==

=== Range ===
As mentioned earlier, Gluvia dorsalis is the only known solifuge native to the Iberian peninsular with it’s range extending from Spain to Portugal.

=== Habitat ===
Typically found in open, low-vegetation grasslands and semi-Arid areas with occasional, summer rain showers, Gluvia dorsalis can be found in forests although it is much rarer and seldom-seen out of it’s natural habitat. They do not prefer areas with high-humidity and better correlate with higher temperatures.
