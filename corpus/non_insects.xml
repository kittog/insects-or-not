There are 23 families and 3300 species of pseudoscorpion. Pseudoscorpions live worldwide, but mainly live in deserts, beaches, tropical, and sub-tropical regions. The order of pseudoscorpions is [[Pseudoscorpiones]].

Nine families and 1400 species of scorpions exist in the world today. Their stings contain [[venom]] that will cause pain where you are stung, but the smaller the scorpion, the more venom it has. A scorpion's feeding habits consist only of [[insect]]s. The order of scorpions is [[Scorpiones]]. 

== Biology ==

=== Morphology ===
scorpions are mainly characterised by their modified frontal pair of pedipalps resembling a crabs pincers as well as the long metasoma (tails) at their rear with a venomous bulb (telson) at the end on the tail linked to a stinger (aculeus)They have 8 pairs of appendages, and a cephalothorax (fused head &amp; body). Their abdomens are usually long and elliptical. They vary colour and sizes ranging between 4-12 cm in terms of body length. The largest scorpion reaches 23 cm in length whereas the smallest is just 0.5 inches long. They are usually brown, beige, black, grey, orange and red in colour. A notable feature is the fact that they carry a fluorescent substance in their exoskeleton which glows under UV light&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Behaviour ===

==== Threat display ====
Both sexes display a unique display upon being threatened which involves the raising and inclining their metasoma towards the threat and raising their pincers. A few insect species are known to mimic a scorpion threat display (such as [[Extatosoma tiaratum]]) 

==== Courtship dance ====
during couplation, the female and male grasp onto each other’s pincers and “dance” all the while they reproduce.

==== Feeding habits ====
scorpions are [[Predacious]] animals and usually feed on a variety of invertebrates. Some can also become cannibal in the absence of food sources. Large tropical species can consume vertebrates such as mice. The are known to feed on insects, spiders and smaller scorpion species.

=== Life cycle ===
The female gives birth to live young and she carries them on her back till they molt and mature&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion&lt;/ref&gt;. The young ones are pale and coloureless. They are hemimatobolous with no pupal stage and undergo a direct transition from juvenile to adults.

=== Toxicity ===
scorpions are usually not very dangerous to humans, only 25 species can seriously harm a human (less than 1% of all species&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion&lt;/ref&gt;) the most fatal sting is delivered by the [[Deathstalker]] (it really lives up to the name). The larger the pincers, the lower the toxicity the ones that are large are usually not very dangerous.

=== Predation ===
Information is yet to be inserted.

== Geolocation ==

=== Range ===
Scorpions can be found throughout the world on all continents except Antarctica.

=== Habitats ===
Scorpions are most commonly found in dry or humid areas notably ones with high temperatures. Their preferred habitats include desert regions, scrub lands, tropical rainforests etc.

'''arachnid''', (class Arachnida), any member of the arthropod group that includes spiders, daddy longlegs, scorpions, and (in the subclass Acari) the mites and ticks, as well as lesser-known subgroups. Only a few species are of economic importance—for example, the mites and ticks, which transmit diseases to humans, other animals, and plants.

== Morphology ==
Arachnids range in size from tiny mites that measure 0.08 mm (0.003 inch) to the enormous scorpion ''Hadogenes troglodytes'' of Africa, which may be 21 cm (8 inches) or more in length. In appearance, they vary from short-legged, round-bodied mites and pincer-equipped scorpions with curled tails to delicate, long-legged daddy longlegs and robust, hairy tarantulas. Like all arthropods, arachnids have segmented bodies, tough exoskeletons, and jointed appendages. Most are predatory. Arachnids lack jaws and, with only a few exceptions, inject digestive fluids into their prey before sucking its liquefied remains into their mouths. Except among daddy longlegs and the mites and ticks, in which the entire body forms a single region, the arachnid body is divided into two distinct regions: the cephalothorax, or prosoma, and the abdomen, or opisthosoma. The sternites (ventral plates) of the lower surface of the body show more variation than do the tergites (dorsal plates). The arachnids have simple (as opposed to compound) eyes.

=== Internal Anatomy ===
The arachnid exoskeleton is formed of chitin, a nitrogen-containing carbohydrate associated with a protein. This complex results in a tough but pliable external skeleton. The exoskeleton consists of two parts, the thin outer epicuticle, which usually contains a wax and is impermeable to water, and a thicker endocuticle. Membranes, flexible portions of the cuticle, are present wherever there are articulations. Growth can occur only by shedding the old exoskeleton, a process termed molting or ecdysis. This process is under hormonal control and involves the secretion of a new cuticle below the old one. Hardening (sclerotization) may be accompanied by pigmentation.

==== Muscular System ====
The muscles of the cephalothorax are well developed, while those of the abdomen are reduced. The muscles are striated, similar to those of vertebrates. Muscles in the legs have their origin either on the endosternite or on the body wall and extend to the basal segments of the appendages. Muscles within the appendages make possible the movements of the individual segments.

==== Nervous system ====
The muscles of the cephalothorax are well developed, while those of the abdomen are reduced. The muscles are striated, similar to those of vertebrates. Muscles in the legs have their origin either on the endosternite or on the body wall and extend to the basal segments of the appendages. Muscles within the appendages make possible the movements of the individual segments.

==== Stimulus ====
There are commonly three types of sense organs: tactile hairs called trichobothria, simple eyes (ocelli), and slit (lyriform) sense organs. Specialized structures, possibly serving as tactile organs or detectors of air movements, include malleoli (racket organs) of sunspiders and comblike appendages (pectines) of scorpions. The number of simple eyes found on the carapace varies. Scorpions, for example, may have as many as five pairs of simple eyes on the sides of the carapace in addition to a median pair, while daddy longlegs have only median eyes, and many cryptic or cave-dwelling species have either reduced eyes or none at all. 

==== Digestive system ====
With the exception of some daddy longlegs and mites, arachnids are carnivorous, relying upon smaller arthropods for their food. Most species partially digest their prey as it is held in the chelicerae. The digestive system is a tube that begins with the mouth, situated below the chelicerae, and leads into the pharynx, then into the esophagus, and from there into the sucking stomach, which has heavy muscles and serves to pump the partially digested food into the midgut, where special enzymes digest the food. The absorptive surface of the midgut is increased by a series of blind sacs (gastric caecae). 

==== Respiratory system ====
Two types of respiratory organs are found among arachnids: book lungs and tracheae. Book lungs are found in hardened pockets generally located on the underside of the abdomen. Diffusion of gases occurs between the hemolymph circulating within thin leaflike structures (lamellae) stacked like pages in a book within the pocket and the air in spaces between these thin structures. The tracheal system consists of a number of tubes that open to the exterior by paired respiratory pores (spiracles) and is similar to that of insects. Diffusion of gases occurs within small fluid-filled tubes that ramify over the internal organs. Scorpions, tailless whip scorpions, and whip scorpions rely upon book lungs. Pseudoscorpions, sunspiders, ricinuleids, daddy longlegs, and mites and ticks have only tracheae.

== Ecology ==
The numbers and predaceous habits of arachnids make them important to humans. Free-living mites play an important role in the conversion of leaf mold to humus. Many mites are parasitic, and many ticks are intermediate hosts for organisms that cause serious diseases. Though all spiders possess poison that can be utilized for subduing prey, only a few have a poison sufficiently powerful to affect humans. A bite of the black widow spider (''Latrodectus mactans'') may result in discomfort or serious illness, whereas that of the brown recluse spider (''Loxosceles reclusa'') may result in a severe local reaction, including tissue death. The sting of some scorpions may cause a severe reaction and even death.

== Life Cycle ==

=== Reproduction ===

==== Indirect Sperm Transfer ====
In most cases the male does not transfer spermatozoa directly to the female but rather initiates courtship rituals in which the female is induced to accept the gelatinous sperm capsule (spermatophore). During mating the sperm are transferred to a sac (spermatheca) within the female reproductive system. The eggs are fertilized as they are laid. Mating in sunspiders is more active, occurring at dusk or during the night. During courting the male seizes the female, lays her on her side, massages her undersurface, opens her genital orifice, and forces a mass of sperm into her spermatheca. Reproductive behaviour in mites is highly variable; sperm usually are produced in a spermatophore and transferred to the female either by the chelicerae or, in ricinuleids, by the third pair of legs of the male.

==== Direct Sperm Transfer ====
The daddy longlegs appear to be the only arachnids in which sperm transfer is direct. There is little or no courtship among the members of this class. Instead, mating occurs whenever a male and female encounter one another. The male has a chitinized penis that is inserted into the genital opening of the female as the partners face one another.

=== Egg Development ===
Among scorpions the fertilized eggs develop inside the mother, and the young are born alive. In scorpions whose eggs contain much yolk, the eggs develop within the oviduct; in those with little yolk, the eggs remain in place, and each embryo lies in a diverticulum (hollow outpouching) with a tubular extension through which nutrient fluids pass from the wall of the maternal intestine. When the young are sufficiently developed, they are expelled and carried about on the mother’s back until after the first molt. False scorpions carry their eggs in a brood sac attached to the genitalia. The embryos develop and grow within this brood sac and are nourished by the female.

=== Nymphal Stage ===
Growth occurs by molting, or ecdysis. In many arachnids the first molt occurs while the animal is still within the egg. The newly hatched arachnid is small, and the exoskeleton is less sclerotized (hardened) than that of the adult. With the exception of the mites and ticks and the ricinuleids, which have three pairs of legs when hatched, the hatchlings have four pairs of legs. The number of molts required for attaining maturity varies considerably, especially among the larger species, which may molt up to 10 times. Before molting, arachnids seek a protected site. Most spiders, false scorpions, and some mites produce a cocoon to protect themselves at this time. Mites differ in both development and growth. In the life cycle of the mite, unlike other arachnids, an egg hatches into a six-legged, or hexapod, larva, which passes through one or several immature (nymphal) stages before becoming an adult. Most mites lay the eggs, though in some species the eggs develop within the body of the female and hatch within or immediately after extrusion (ovoviviparous). Some of the Acari are also able to reproduce from unfertilized eggs (parthenogenesis). The life cycle of ticks is similar to that of mites.

== Behavior ==

=== Movement ===
Locomotion among arachnids involves moving the first and third legs of one side and the second and fourth legs of the other side forward nearly simultaneously. Most arachnids are not great travelers. Those that do cover long distances rely upon methods other than walking or running. For example, small spiders about to migrate will scale vertical objects, release a strand of silk, and rely upon the wind to carry them away (ballooning). 

=== Feeding Habits ===
As predators, most arachnids feed chiefly upon smaller arthropods, although exceptions are found among parasitic ticks and mites and plant-feeding daddy longlegs and mites. Ticks and mites are nourished principally by fluids obtained either from living animal or plant material or from decaying organic matter. Parasitic forms have mouthparts modified for sucking blood or juice. Daddy longlegs appear to be the only arachnids capable of ingesting small particles.

=== Social Interactions ===
Though most arachnids are solitary animals, some spiders live in enormous communal webs housing males, females, and spiderlings. Most of the individuals live in the central part of the web, with the outer part providing snare space for prey shared by all the inhabitants. In some cool and dry areas, daddy longlegs often gather in enormous numbers, probably protecting themselves against extremes of temperature or desiccation. 

== Identification Features ==
Though arachnids are easily recognized by the division of the body into two parts, the cephalothorax (prosoma) and abdomen (opisthosoma), and their possession of six pairs of appendages, they are extremely diverse in form. The dorsal region of the cephalothorax has a solid covering called the carapace, and the underside has one or more sternal plates or the coxal (basal) segments of the six pairs of appendages.

== For hunting ==
In case of Arachnids such as jumping spiders, sand spiders and wolf spiders, pedipalps are an extra limb located near the mouth, it is used to grab the prey tightly and inject it with a harpoon of potent venom consuming it in the process. These "Extra" mouthparts are highly flexible joins and are greatly specialized for a particular task of sizing the prey into a simpler form which the predator itself can consume slowly.

== As stimulus ==
Some species have pedipalps covered with sensory hairs which allows them to be used for a secondary purpose which is the sense of touch and taste. These arachnids have poor eyesight, multipurpose pedipalps are common among tarantulas and other Larger spiders.

{{Infobox_100|title1=Thelyphonida|order=Thelyphonida|phylum=[[Arthropoda]]|class=[[Insecta]]|family=[[Thelyphonidae]]|image1=81BC182F-9574-482F-9AB0-05E55C31877C.png}}

'''vinegaroons'''. For the categoy of whip scorpions on this wiki, see [[:Category:Thelyphonida|'''Thelyphonida''']].

== Morphology ==
Vinegaroons are beautiful arachnids that have a close resemblance to [[Scorpion|true scorpions]]. They have fairly large bodies and somewhat flattened cephalothorax, several small ocelli. The the frontal pair of legs is thinner, antennae-like limb, the pedipalps are very large, thick, short and possess sharp spikes to ensure the prey can’t escape. The name “'''Vinegar'''oon” is highly appropriate as these Arthropods have long, whip-like caudal appendages (Flagellum) that release acetic acid when the scorpion is threatened. They’re usually dark in colour and may reach upto 85 mm in length.

== Behaviour ==

=== Feeding Habits ===
[[File:C7855158-DD37-4934-B694-8BA2A8239DA1.jpeg|thumb]]
Whip scorpions are [[Predacious]] in nature and feed on whatever is smaller in size.

=== Defensive mechanism ===
Their primary defence is the utilisation of the vinegar-like acid sprayed through the caudal appendage or a voracious bite. Signs of aggression are usually determined by a threat display.

==== Threat display ====
[[File:FC011E7B-1CB3-49A5-A063-6CDB3BF0D1BC.png|thumb]]
Threat display involves raising the abdomen and caudal appendages upright angled at the prey with pedipalps wide open to reveal the spikes.

=== Hunting ===
The prey is held upright by the second pair of antenna-like limbs while the pedipalps mutilate the prey and push it into the mouth The prey is dragged into the whip scorpion’s lair (usually an underground burrow or a ditch) before being consumed whole.

== Life Cycle ==
A few months after fertilisation of eggs, the female burrows herself in a ditch where the eggs are laid. The female then sticks the eggs onto her abdomen to ensure they won’t touch the ground. Similar to [[Whip-spider]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s the young ones are carried onto the mother’s back. The first instar of nymphs is pale white which later changes to a miniature version of the adults after the first molt. They are [[Hemimetabolous]].

== Geological distribution ==
They are found throughout the world’s equatorial rainforests except Australia and Europe. Only one known species inhabits African continent i.e [[Etienneus africanus]].

=== Habitat ===
Vinegaroons inhabit caves, equatorial, continental and tropical rainforests, they can also be ground dwelling arachnids (especially larger species) living in caves and burrows.

(although this alternate name may also imply to another species of scorpion I.e [[Heterometrus spinifer]])

== Morphology ==
Gigantometrus swammerdami is the largest known scorpion, some specimen are known to reach an astounding 23 cm in length.  Gigantometrus swammerdami is a rather attractive species of scorpion with a leathery, rigid exoskeleton. Their carapace is mainly reddish-black, occasionally brown the juveniles are usually brown with a yellow-coloured telson.  Gigantometrus swammerdami are known to weigh as much as 56 gm.  Manus completely covered by large rounded granulae, but without true carinae. Pedipalp patella lacks a pronounced internal tubercle. Carapace with a smooth disc in which the margins and posterior portion are granulate. Telson bulbous, and the vesicle longer than aculeus.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantometrus_swammerdami&lt;/ref&gt; They have 16-20 comb-like teeth known as [[Pectinal teeth]].

== Ecology ==

=== Hunting ===
G. Swammerdami has evolved in such as way to not be reliant on their toxic secretions &lt;ref&gt;https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/340922-Heterometrus-swammerdami&lt;/ref&gt;but rather use their impressive, large pincers to crush and tear apart their prey, the peak hunting season for this species usually occurs during mid-summers. Known for being both Nocturnal but can rarely be found during daytime. &lt;ref&gt;https://factanimal.com/giant-forest-scorpion/&lt;/ref&gt;This solitary species rise from their burrows during late evening and hunting sessions can last overnight [Critation needed]. They may also use their pectinal teeth to locate chemical trails left behind by their prey in a manner similar to desert centipedes.&lt;ref&gt;https://factanimal.com/giant-forest-scorpion/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feeding ====
They usually feed on a large array of animals most notable ones include smaller arachnids, insects and possibly even small mammals such as mice.

=== Courtship &amp; maternal care ===
As with most scorpions, this species is ovoviviparous and give birth to live young. The courtship “dance” is exhibited by this species or not remains as an unanswered question . Females show maternal care, carrying the infants on her back until their exoskeleton hardens. 

== Geological distribution ==

=== Range ===
The species ranges from Sri Lanka to the western ghats of India.&lt;ref&gt;https://factanimal.com/giant-forest-scorpion/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat ===
The habitats for this species usually occurs in either moderate-temperature areas to tropical rainforests. This species can be found in the Tropical-wet monsoon zone of India.

Both of the species were discovered in Central Peru, guano islands in the Ica region, inhabiting the coastal deserts.

== Discovery ==
[[File:Chinchippus .png|thumb|Chinchippus viejaensis ]]
The discovery of  Chinchippus peruvianus is known by the single female specimen discovered in central Peru’s arid, coastal desert regions. The discovery of Chinchippus viejaensis in 2009 was established upon the examination of the stomach contents of a desert gecko.

== Ecology ==
At the time being due to the fact that the availability of information on both the species is scarce the only assumptions that can be made is regarding their diet which could possibly be compromised of maritime prey such as springtails and amphipods it may also be considered true that they exhibit scavenger hunting behaviour feeding off Dead Sea bird carcasses.

== Identification ==
Harvestmen belong to the class Arachnida, the same class as spiders, scorpions, and mites. However, harvestmen are not true spiders. They have a single body segment, whereas spiders have two. They also lack the venom glands and spinnerets found in spiders. Harvestmen have eight legs, fang-like mouthparts, and pedipalps (feelers) near the mouth, and they lack antennae. Female harvestmen tend to have larger bodies and shorter legs than males.

== Habitat ==
Harvestmen prefer moist, shady environments, and they can often be found in caves, shade of wood or plant growth, and basements where there is little light. Some harvestmen species search the ground and plants carefully for dead or slow moving insects, insect eggs, earthworms, and decaying plant material for food.

== Life Cycle ==
Female harvestmen lay eggs by the hundreds into moist soil in the fall. When young harvestmen hatch in the spring, they look like tiny adults. As they develop into adults, the young harvestmen molt to accommodate their growing bodies. Adult harvestmen live for about one year. They are often seen in high numbers in the fall, around harvest time, as their name suggests.

== Urban Impact ==
Harvestmen are not cause for medical or economic concern. They do not damage buildings or structures if they are found clustering indoors. They are considered beneficial insects because they feed upon multiple pests. Contrary to popular beliefs, harvestmen are not the most venomous spider on the planet: they are not venomous, and they are not spiders. If handled, they may emit a pungent odor as a defense against most predators.

== Prevention ==
To prevent harvestmen from entering homes and buildings, seal the foundation, inspect any window or door screens for holes, reduce clutter from around the foundation, and reduce any potential food sources for harvestmen to keep them from entering or growing high numbers within the facility. Remove clutter which can serve as a hiding spot for spiders. If harvestmen activity is observed indoors, remove them from the building and place outdoors or simply vacuum. Pesticides are not recommended because harvestmen are beneficial, and each harvestman would require direct application of the pesticide

==Description==
''L. rotundum'' is chestnut-brown, with a very long round or oval body and thin black legs.[1] There is no separation between the head and the abdomen. The body is smooth and small. The harvestman's legs can be self-amputated if it is in danger of predation, but they do not regenerate. Although the harvestman has no fangs, poison glands, or silk glands, it can protect itself with the scent glands on the front of its body. The scent glands produce a secretion that repels predators.[2] The species has three different types of nephrocytes. Numerous large nephrocytes occur in clusters between the muscles in the anterior region of the body. Smaller nephrocytes are scattered throughout the body, often stuck to tracheoles. The third type of nephrocyte is attached to the heart wall by connective ligaments.[3] The morphology of the tracheae in this species is very similar to that of ''[[Nemastoma lugubre]]''.
==Habitat==
This harvestman is widespread throughout Britain including the Channel Islands. It can also be found on the Canary Islands and in Africa.[2] The species can be found among vegetation such as long grass, herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees.

rare species of troglobitic opilione. T. Reddelli was added to the United States endangered species list in 1988. 
==Morphology ==
[[File:Texella reddelli(2).png|thumb]]
These arachnids are about 1/8 of an inch (3.175 mm) long with a unique orange coloration and long, delicate legs. Juveniles have a yellowish-white body. They have small, well-developed yet ineffectual eyes broadly set in conical eye moods, and elongated appendages, thin appendages reaching about 0.07-0.09 inches on average. 

It can be distinguished from it’s closest relative The bone cave harvestman (T. Reyesi) by its shorter appendages and it’s colouration.

== Behaviour ==

=== Feeding ===
T. Reddelli exclusively preys on [[Springtail|Colembolans]] by using its modified pedipalps to grasp onto its prey. It utilises its foremost pair of appendages for locomotion through its lightless environment. No information about the life cycle of T. Reddelli is known.

== Life history ==
''Texella reddelli'' is a type of [[:Category:Troglobitic species|troglobite]]. These species survived in the cave environment and adapted to it. The Karst terrain created caves that were not always connected with each other. This brought about "islands" of individual populations that were disconnected for long periods of time.[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''] Over time the separate groups became different species because of the isolation. The rate at which each population speciated was different. The species that are more mobile have larger ranges and are less isolated. Since they are all still relatively close together, disturbances can make them highly susceptible to extinction. They require stable temperatures and often stay in remote corners or the ceiling of the cave that are the warmest.

== Threats ==
The primary threat to the Bee Creek Cave harvestman and other cave invertebrates, more specifically invasive species. The most notable invasive species which has proven to have bought a significant threat to T. Reddelli populations. in its range is the loss of its habitat. Residential and urban areas continue to grow in this region. As a result, many caves have been paved over or filled in. Because the caves are formed by seeping water, any change or alteration in the flow of that water can change the environment of a cave. To meet the needs of these newly populated areas, much of this water has been diverted. Some caves have become dry while others have become flooded. Pollution from populated areas has also seeped into the groundwater, and the water in many caves has become contaminated.

== Distribution ==
This harvestman is an example of a localized cave fauna found in Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas. It has been collected from five caves in the region and is suspected to occupy a sixth.

The size of the Bee Creek Cave harvestman population has not been estimated, but the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) biologists believe that the species may be more limited in numbers than previously thought. This harvestman has been collected from Tooth, Bee Creek, McDonald, Weldon, and Bone Caves. In 1984, it was reported from Root Cave in Travis County, but its presence there has not been confirmed.

==Geographical range ==

=== Range ===
They are found in Kretschmarr Double Pit and Jester Estates Cave, north of the Colorado River on the Jollyville Plateau, and in three caves in the Rollingwood karst fauna region in Travis County, Texas.

=== Habitat ===
Bee Creek Cave Harvestman inhabit limestone caves. They are only able to survive in caves that maintain stable temperatures and humidity (close to 100%). They have been found in caves both on the north and south side of the Colorado river. They live in 'karst' type of terrain in Travis County.

The species was discovered in April 2012 near a cave in the southern province of Khammouan, by Dr. Peter Jäger of the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, Germany, whilst shooting a television documentary about the wildlife of Laos.

==Physical description==
The giant Laotian harvestman dwells inside the caves of Laos, and has a leg span stretching just over 330 millimeters (13 inches), thus making it the second largest harvestman discovered so far - surpassed only by another species in South America. It is currently unknown why it has such a large leg span, but it is believed that, since opiliones breathe[clarification needed] through their legs, a larger leg span makes respiration easier in the caves' low oxygen environment.

==Predators==
Predators of the giant Laotian harvestman most likely include the larger but not as lengthy [[giant huntsman spider]] (''Heteropoda maxima''), ''Thereuopoda longicornis'',[2] other larger arthropods in terms of body mass - such as other predatory [[centipede]]s, [[huntsman spider]]s and larger arachnids - and small cave mammals.

==Description==
Males are a bit longer than 2 mm, females 5 mm.
==Distribution==
It was originally described from Bat Cave, Carter County, Kentucky and New Hampshire, and a year later found under rotten logs in a deep gorge at Ithaca, New York.[1]

''S. cavicolens'' is distributed over the eastern part of North America, south in the mountains of North Carolina. It is very closely related to ''S. paradoxum'' and other European species, but quite different from the other ''Sabacon'' species of the eastern US, the smaller ''S. mitchelli''.

The six families are currently grouped into two infraorders, the Tropicophthalmi and the Temperophthalmi; however, these are not supported by modern phylogenetic analysis.

They are smaller than the more familiar "daddy long-legs" harvestmen, with adults ranging from 1 to 6mm, including legs. Moreover, their legs are comparatively short compared to their body length, typically shorter than the body. Some superficially resemble mites. Their coloration is almost always some shade of brown, with a heavily sclerotized body, and they are quite inconspicuous, residing in leaf litter or in caves.[1] Many cyphophthalmids are eyeless, and presumably rely on olfactory cues to find food and mates. Their scent glands are located on special elevated cones called ozophores. They have low dispersal rates and consequently high endemism.
==Relationships==
Cyphophthalmi is one of the two lineages of harvestmen, the other, containing the Laniatores, Dyspnoi and Eupnoi is also called Phalangida.[1] Although they are grouped into the infraorders Temperophthalmi and Tropicophthalmi, this division is not supported by either molecular or morphological data.[3] DNA sequence data suggests that Neogoveidae and Troglosironidae form a monophyletic group.
==Distribution==
Cyphophthalmids are found on all continents, with the exception of Antarctica, where they probably also once lived. As they did not disperse onto any oceanic islands, and it is believed that they did not travel between separate landmasses, they make an interesting subject for biogeography. Each of the six currently recognized families has a distinct distribution:[5]
*Stylocellidae, species of which are found from India to New Guinea
*Ogoveidae, species of which occur in West Africa
*Neogoveidae cyphophthalmids only occur Neotropical ecosystems between Florida and Ecuador, and in western equatorial Africa
*Pettalidae cyphophthalmids are found in South America, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand, demonstrating a Gondwana distribution.
*Sironidae cyphophthalmids show a Laurasian distribution, with most species found in temperate Europe and the west coast of North America
*Troglosironidae cyphophthalmids are restricted to New Caledonia. Although they occur in the same region as some *Pettalidae, the two are not closely related.

Colombia shows the largest diversity of cyphophthalmids among countries in South America. This could reflect the large number of ecosystems found there, but could also be due to a high rate of sampling in this country.

The genus contains 31 recognized species[2] distributed worldwide, including the North American [[black widow]]s (''L. mactans'', ''L. hesperus'', and ''L. variolus''), the button spiders of Africa, and the Australian redback. Species vary widely in size. In most cases the females are dark-colored and readily identifiable by reddish hourglass-shaped markings on the abdomen.

The venomous bite of these spiders is considered particularly dangerous because of the neurotoxin latrotoxin, which causes the condition latrodectism, both named for the genus. The female black widow has unusually large venom glands and its bite can be particularly harmful to humans. However, despite the genus' notoriety, ''Latrodectus'' bites are rarely fatal. Only female bites are dangerous to humans.
==Description==
Female widow spiders are typically dark brown or black in color, usually exhibiting a red or orange hourglass on the ventral surface (underside) of the abdomen; some may have a pair of red spots or have no marking at all. They often exhibit various red or red and white markings on the dorsal surface (upper side) of the abdomen, ranging from a single stripe to bars or spots. Females of a few species are paler brown and some have no bright markings.
==Behavior==
The prevalence of sexual cannibalism, a behavior in which the female eats the male after mating, has inspired the common name "widow spiders".[3] Research at the University of Hamburg in Germany suggests this behaviour may promote the survival odds of the offspring;[4] however, females of some species only rarely show this behavior, and much of the documented evidence for sexual cannibalism has been observed in laboratory cages where the males could not escape.

Like other members of the family Theridiidae, the widow spiders construct a web of irregular, tangled, sticky silken fibers. The spider very frequently hangs upside down near the center of its web and waits for insects to blunder in and get stuck. Then, before the insect can extricate itself, the spider rushes over to bite it and wrap it in silk. To feed, it uses its fangs to inject digestive enzymes, liquefying the prey's internal organs.[5] If the spider perceives a threat, it will quickly let itself down to the ground on a safety line of silk. As with other web-weavers, these spiders have very poor eyesight and depend on vibrations reaching them through their webs to find trapped prey or warn them of larger threats. When a widow spider is trapped, it is unlikely to bite, preferring to play dead or flick silk at the potential threat; bites are the result of continual harassment.[6] While some species are more aggressive, most are not: many injuries to humans are due to defensive bites delivered when a spider gets unintentionally squeezed or pinched.

The ultimate tensile strength and other physical properties of ''[[Latrodectus Hesperus]]'' (western black widow) silk were found to be similar to the properties of silk from orb-weaving spiders that had been tested in other studies. The tensile strength for the three kinds of silk measured in the Blackledge study was about 1000 MPa. The ultimate strength reported in a previous study for ''[[Nephila edulis]]'' was b1290 MPa ± 160 MPa.[7] The tensile strength of spider silk is comparable to that of steel wire of the same thickness.[8] However, as the density of steel is about six times that of silk,[9] silk is correspondingly stronger than steel wire of the same weight.

Spiders of the genus ''Steatoda'' (also of the Theridiidae family) are often mistaken for widow spiders, and are known as "[[false widow spider]]s"; they are significantly less harmful to humans.

It is an [[orb-weaver spider]] found in Europe and North America.
==Range==
''A. diadematus'' is found throughout Europe and across North America, from southern Canada to Mexico, and from British Columbia to Newfoundland.
==Size and markings==
Individual spiders' colourings can range from extremely light yellow to very dark grey, but all ''A. diadematus'' have mottled white markings across the dorsal abdomen, with four or more segments forming a cross. The markings are formed in cells filled with guanine, which is a byproduct of protein metabolism.[5]

Adult females range in length from 6.5 to 20 mm (0.26 to 0.79 in), while males range from 5.5 to 13 mm (0.22 to 0.51 in).[6] Occasionally, the female will eat the male directly after mating. (See video below.)

They are the most common group of builders of spiral wheel-shaped webs often found in gardens, fields and forests. "Orb" was previously used in English to mean "circular",[2] hence the English name of the group. Araneids have eight similar eyes, hairy or spiny legs, and no stridulating organs.[1]

The family is cosmopolitan, including many well-known large or brightly colored garden spiders. With around 3,100 species in 169 genera worldwide, Araneidae is the third-largest family of spiders (behind Salticidae and Linyphiidae).[1] Araneid webs are constructed in a stereotyped fashion. A framework of nonsticky silk is built up before the spider adds a final spiral of silk covered in sticky droplets.

Orb-webs are also produced by members of other spider families. The large golden orb-weavers (Nephilidae) and the long-jawed orb weavers (Tetragnathidae) were formerly included in the Araneidae; they are closely related, being part of the superfamily Araneoidea. The cribellate or hackled orb-weavers (Uloboridae) belong to a different group of spiders. Their webs are strikingly similar, but use a different kind of sticky silk.
==The orb-web==
Generally, orb-weaving spiders are three-clawed builders of flat webs with sticky spiral capture silk. The building of a web is an engineering feat, begun when the spider floats a line on the wind to another surface. The spider secures the line and then drops another line from the center, making a "Y". The rest of the scaffolding follows with many radii of nonsticky silk being constructed before a final spiral of sticky capture silk.

The third claw is used to walk on the nonsticky part of the web. Characteristically, the prey insect that blunders into the sticky lines is stunned by a quick bite, and then wrapped in silk. If the prey is a venomous insect, such as a wasp, wrapping may precede biting.

Many orb-weavers build a new web each day. Most orb-weavers tend to be active during the evening hours; they hide for most of the day. Generally, towards evening, the spider will consume the old web, rest for approximately an hour, then spin a new web in the same general location. Thus, the webs of orb-weavers are generally free of the accumulation of detritus common to other species, such as black widow spiders.

Some orb-weavers do not build webs at all. Members of the genera ''[[Mastophora]]'' in the Americas, ''[[Cladomelea]]'' in Africa, and ''[[Ordgarius]]'' in Australia produce sticky globules, which contain a pheromone analog. The globule is hung from a silken thread dangled by the spider from its front legs. The pheromone analog attracts male moths of only a few species. These get stuck on the globule and are reeled in to be eaten. Interestingly, both types of bolas spiders are highly camouflaged and difficult to locate.

The spiny orb-weaving spiders in the genera ''[[Gasteracantha]]'' and ''[[Micrathena]]'' look like plant seeds or thorns hanging in their orb-webs. Some species of ''Gasteracantha'' have very long, horn-like spines protruding from their abdomens.

One feature of the webs of some orb-weavers is the stabilimentum, a crisscross band of silk through the center of the web. It is found in a number of genera, but ''[[Argiope]]'', the yellow and banded garden spiders of North America, is a prime example. The band has been hypothesized to be a lure for prey, a marker to warn birds away from the web, and a camouflage for the spider when it sits in the center of the web. However, recent research suggests the stabilimentum actually decreases the visibility of the silk to insects, thus making it harder for prey to avoid the web.[3] The orb-web consists of a frame and supporting radii overlaid with a sticky capture spiral, and the silks used by orb-weaver spiders have exceptional mechanical properties to withstand the impact of flying prey.[4]

During the Cretaceous, a radiation of angiosperm plants and their insect pollinators occurred. Fossil evidence shows that the orb web was in existence at this time, which permitted a concurrent radiation of the spider predators along with their insect prey.[5][6] The capacity of orb–webs to absorb the impact of flying prey led orbicularian spiders to become the dominant predators of aerial insects in many ecosystems.[7] Insects and spiders have comparable rates of diversification, suggesting they co-radiated, and the peak of this radiation occurred 100 Mya before the origin of angiosperms.[8] Vollrath and Selden (2007) make the bold proposition that insect evolution was driven less by flowering plants than by spider predation – particularly through orb webs – as a major selective force.

Most arachnid webs are vertical and the spiders usually hang with their head downward. A few webs, such as those of orb-weavers in the genus ''[[Metepiera]]'' have the orb hidden within a tangled space of web. Some ''Metepiera'' are semisocial and live in communal webs. In Mexico, such communal webs have been cut out of trees or bushes and used for living fly paper.[citation needed] In 2009, workers at a Baltimore Wastewater Treatment Plant called for help to deal with over 100 million orb-weaver spiders, living in a community that managed to spin a phenomenal web that covered some 4 acres of a building with spider densities in some areas reaching 35,176 spiders per cubic meter.
==Natural history==
The oldest known true orb-weaver is ''[[Mesozygiella dunlopi]]'', from the Lower Cretaceous. Several fossils provide direct evidence that the three major orb-weaving families, namely Araneidae, Tetragnathidae and Uloboridae, had evolved by this time, about 140 million years ago.[10] They probably originated during the Jurassic (200 to 140 million years ago). Based on new molecular evidence in silk genes, all three families are likely to have a common origin.[4][6][7]

The two families, Deinopoidea and Araneoidea, have similar behavioral sequences and spinning apparatuses to produce architecturally similar webs. The Araneidae weave true viscid silk with an aqueous glue property, and the Deinopoidea use dry fibrils and sticky silk.[4][11] The Deinopoidea (including the Uloboridae), have a cribellum – a flat, complex spinning plate from which the cribellate silk is released.[12]

They also have a calamistrum – an apparatus of bristles used to comb the cribellate silk from the cribellum. The Araneoidea, or the "ecribellate" spiders, do not have these two structures. The two families of orb-weaving spiders are morphologically very distinct, yet there is much similarity between their web form and web construction behavior. The cribellates retained the ancestral character, yet the cribellum was lost in the escribellates. The lack of a functional cribellum in araneoids is most likely synapomorphic.[12]

If the orb-weaver spiders are a monophyletic group, the fact that only some species in the group lost a feature adds to the controversy. The cribellates are split off as a separate taxon that retained the primitive feature, which makes the lineage paraphyletic and not synonymous with any real evolutionary lineage. The morphological and behavioral evidence surrounding orb webs led to the disagreement over a single origin or a dual origin.[12] However, molecular analysis provides more support for a monophyletic origin.

They are well known for the distinctive black and red coloring of the female of the species that will occasionally eat her mate after reproduction. The species is native to North America. The venom is seldom fatal to healthy humans.
==Taxonomy==
''Latrodectus mactans'' was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775, placing it in the genus Aranea.[1][3] It was transferred to the genus Latrodectus in 1837 by Charles Walckenaer and is currently placed in the Theridiidae family of the order Araneae.[1] The species is closely related to ''[[Latrodectus Hesperus]]'' (western black widow) and ''[[Latrodectus variolus]]'' (northern black widow). Members of the three species are often confused with the genus Steatoda, the false widows. Prior to 1970, when the current taxonomic divisions for North American black widows were set forth by Kaston,[4] all three varieties were classified as a single species, ''L. mactans''. As a result, there exist numerous references which claim that "black widow" (without any geographic modifier) applies to ''L. mactans'' alone. Common usage of the term "black widow" makes no distinction between the three species.
==Description==
The body length (excluding legs) of the mature female is 8–13 mm (0.31–0.51 in), 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) for males. Legs are long in proportion to body.[5] Females are shiny and black in color, with a red marking in the shape of an hourglass on the ventral (under) side of her very rounded abdomen.[6] There is much variation in female size, particularly in egg-carrying (gravid) females. The abdomen of a gravid female can be more than 1.25 cm (0.5 in) in diameter. Many female widows also have an orange or red patch just above the spinnerets on the top of the abdomen.[7] Juveniles have a distinctly different appearance from the adults; the abdomen is grayish to black with white stripes running across it and is spotted with yellow and orange.[7] Males are either purple, or closer to the appearance of the juveniles in color.

The web of the black widow spider is a three-dimensional tangled cobweb of exceptionally strong silk.

The female's body is 14–16 mm (1/2 in) in length and is black, often with an hourglass-shaped red mark on the lower abdomen. This "hourglass" mark can be yellow, and on rare occasions, white. The male of the species is around half this length and generally a tan color with lighter striping on the abdomen. The population was previously described as a subspecies of ''[[Latrodectus mactans]]'' and it is closely related to the northern species ''[[Latrodectus variolus]]''. The species, as with others of the genus, build irregular or "messy" webs: Unlike the spiral webs or the tunnel-shaped webs of other spiders, the strands of a Latrodectus web have no apparent organization. Female black widows have potent venom composed of neurotoxins. Fatalities usually only happen with children and the elderly, however medical treatment may be required for others as well. However, the male black widow is harmless to humans. The female's consumption of the male after courtship, a cannibalistic and suicidal behavior observed in ''[[Latrodectus hasseltii]]'' (Australia's redback),[2] is rare in this species. Male western widows may breed several times during their relatively short lifespans.[3] Males are known to show preference for mating with well-fed females over starved ones, taking cues from the females' webs.
==Range==
''Latrodectus hesperus'' can be found in western regions of North America. In Canada it can be found from British Columbia, to Manitoba They are most commonly found near the Canada-US border, as well less commonly throughout prairies regions of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada.
==Sexual behavior==
Female stimulates by contact with male webs Male and female ''Latrodectus hesperus'' produce sexually specific scents which are combined with their silk; each sex responds by initiating mating when it comes in contact with a web of the opposite sex.

It is a member of the cosmopolitan genus Latrodectus, the widow spiders. The adult female is easily recognized by her spherical black body with a prominent red stripe on the upper side of her abdomen and an hourglass-shaped red/orange streak on the underside. Females have a body length of about 10 millimetres (0.4 in), while the male is much smaller, being only 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long.

Mainly nocturnal, the female redback lives in an untidy web in a warm sheltered location, commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Male spiders and spiderlings often live on the periphery of the female spiders' web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of few arachnids which usually display sexual cannibalism while mating. The sperm is then stored in the spermathecae, organs of the female reproductive tract, and can be used up to two years later to fertilize several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in New Zealand, Japan, and in greenhouses in Belgium.

The redback is one of the few spider species that can be seriously harmful to humans, and its preferred habitat has led it to being responsible for the large majority of serious spider bites in Australia. Predominantly neurotoxic to vertebrates, the venom gives rise to the syndrome of latrodectism in humans; this starts with pain around the bite site, which typically becomes severe and progresses up the bitten limb and persists for over 24 hours. Sweating in localized patches of skin occasionally occurs and is highly indicative of latrodectism. Generalized symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, and agitation may also occur and indicate severe poisoning. An antivenom has been available since 1956, and there have been no deaths directly due to redback bites since its introduction.
==Taxonomy and naming==
===Common names===
The common name "redback" is derived from the distinctive red stripe along the dorsal aspect of its abdomen. Other common names include red-striped spider,[2] red-spot spider, jockey spider,[3] Murra-ngura spider, Kapara spider and the Kanna-jeri spider.
===History===
Before DNA analysis, the taxonomy of the widow spider genus ''[[Latrodectus]]'' had been unclear—changes in the number of species reflect the difficulty of using morphology to determine subdivisions within the genus.[5] Substantial interest in their systematics was most likely prompted by the medical importance of these venomous spiders.[5] Swedish arachnologist Tamerlan Thorell described the redback spider in 1870[6] from specimens collected in Rockhampton and Bowen in central Queensland.[7] He named it ''Latrodectus hasseltii'' in honor of colleague A.W.M. van Hasselt.[8] In the same paper, he named a female from Cape York with an all-black abdomen ''L. scelio'',[6][7] now regarded as the same species. These specimens are in the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm.[9]

German arachnologist Friedrich Dahl revised the genus in 1902 and named ''L. ancorifer'' from New Guinea,[10] which was later regarded as a subspecies of the redback. Another subspecies, ''L. h. aruensis'', was described by Norwegian entomologist Embrik Strand in 1911. Subspecies indica (of L. scelio) had been described by Eugène Simon in 1897, but its origin is unclear.[9] Frederick Octavius Pickard-Cambridge questioned Dahl's separating species on what he considered minor anatomical details but Dahl dismissed Pickard-Cambridge as an "ignoramus".[9] Pickard-Cambridge was unsure whether ''L. hasseltii'' warranted species status, though he confirmed scelio and hasseltii as a single species,[7] other researchers such as Ludwig Carl Christian Koch noting the differences to be inconsistent.[2] The redback was also considered by some to be conspecific with the katipo (L. katipo), which is native to New Zealand,[11] though Koch regarded them as distinct.[2]

Reviewing the genus ''[[Lactrodectus]]'' in 1959, arachnologist Herbert Walter Levi concluded that the colour variations were largely continuous across the world and were not suitable for distinguishing the individual species. Instead, he focused on differences in the morphology of the female sexual organs, and revised the number of recognized species from 22 to 6. This included reclassifying the redback and several other species as subspecies of the best-known member of the group, the black widow spider (''[[Latrodectus mactans]]''), found in North America and other regions.[5] He did not consider the subspecies ''L. h. ancorifer'', ''L. h. aruensis'' and ''L. h. indicus'' distinct enough to warrant recognition.[9] Subsequently, more reliable genetic studies have split the genus into about 30 species, and the redback has no recognised subspecies in modern classifications.
===Placement===
A member of the genus ''Latrodectus'' in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider,[5] with the katipo as its closest relative.[13] A 2004 molecular study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behavior of the male during mating.[5] The close relationship between the two species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it.[14] There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild.
==Description==
The adult female redback has a body around 1 centimetre (0.4 in) long, with slender legs, the first pair of which are longer than the rest.[15] The round abdomen is a deep black (occasionally brownish), with a red (sometimes orange) longitudinal stripe on the upper surface and an hourglass-shaped red/orange streak on the underside.[16] Females with incomplete markings or all-black abdomens occasionally occur.[17] The cephalothorax is much smaller than the abdomen, and is black.[15] Redback spiderlings are grey with dark spots,[2] and become darker with each moult.[18] Juvenile females have additional white markings on the abdomen.[16] The bright red colors may serve as a warning to potential predators.[19] Each spider has a pair of venom glands each attached to each of its chelicerae[20] with very small fangs.[21] Small compared to the female,[22] the male redback is 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long and is light brown, with white markings on the upper side of the abdomen and a pale hourglass marking on the underside.[16]

Another species in Australia with a similar physique, ''[[Steatoda capensis]]'', has been termed the "false redback spider", but it is uniformly black (or plum), and does not display the red stripe.

The genus name Gasteracantha derives from the Greek words γαστήρ (gaster, "belly") and ἄκανθα (acantha, "thorn"), while the specific epithet cancriformis derives from the Latin words cancer ("crab") and forma ("shape, form, appearance").
==Description==
Females are 5–9 millimetres (0.20–0.35 in) long and 10–13 mm (0.39–0.51 in) wide. The six abdominal spine-like projections on the abdomen are characteristic. The carapace, legs and underside are black with white spots under the abdomen. Variations occur in the colour of the upperside of the abdomen: a white or yellow colour with both featuring black spots. A white upperside can have either red or black spines while a yellow upperside can only have black ones. Like with many other spiders, males are much smaller (2 to 3 mm long) and longer than wide. They are similar to the females in colour but have a gray abdomen with white spots and the spines are reduced to four or five stubby projections.

This species of spider does not live very long. In fact, the lifespan lasts only until reproduction, which usually takes place in the spring following the winter when they hatched. Females die after producing an egg mass, and males die six days after a complete cycle of sperm induction to the female.
==Distribution and habitat==
It is found across the southern part of the United States from California to Florida, including Alabama as well as in Central America, Jamaica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Bermuda, Puerto Rico, South America (including south and central Brazil, with several variations according to location) and certain islands in the Bahamas. It has also been sighted in the Whitsunday Islands, Australia, South Africa and Palawan, Philippines, as well as Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands, the Antilles and Koh Chang in Thailand eastern seaboard.

It lives in woodland edges and shrubby gardens. Many of the studies on this spider have taken place in citrus groves in Florida. They frequently live in trees or around trees in shrubs.

In the United States it is commonly known as the "banana spider".
==Physical attributes==
''Nephila clavipes'' has the large size and the long legs with clumps of hair that are typical of the genus. It is large compared to most other members of the genus, and is distinguished by the bright colors of the female abdomen, which changes colour as the spider matures.

As is usual among orb-weavers, there is marked sexual dimorphism in general appearance, but especially in size; in linear measurements males are three to four times smaller than females, and they also are more slenderly built. This implies a mass some thirty to seventy times smaller than that of a large female.
==Etymology==
The specific epithet clavipes is derived from the Latin:
*clava, that variously may mean "knotted staff", "club", or "key"; and
*pēs meaning "of or pertaining to a foot".[1]

In assigning the name, Linnaeus apparently referred to the clumps of hair on the legs.

its cephalothorax looking like a human skull, is a spider of the family Pholcidae. 

== Morphology ==
Females have a body length of about 9 mm; males are slightly smaller. Its legs are about 5 or 6 times the length of its body (reaching up to 7 cm of leg span in females). Its habit of living on the ceilings of rooms, caves, garages or cellars gives rise to one of its common names. They’re bodies are usually translucent beige or brown except a large brown patch present on the cephalothorax. The spiderlings are pale white with light-yellow translucent bodies.
==Habitat==
Originally a species restricted to warmer parts of the west Palearctic,[4][better source needed] through the help of humans this synanthrope now occurs throughout a large part of the world.[1][better source needed] It is unable to survive in cold weather, and consequently it is restricted to (heated) houses in some parts of its range.
==Behaviors==

=== Defence mechanism ===
''Pholcus phalangioides'' is not considered aggressive, its first line of defense being to shake its web violently when disturbed as a mechanism against predators. Pholcus phalangioides  exhibit autonomy upon rough handling or when threatened.

=== Feeding habits ===
With the use of their messy, tangled webs,  Pholcus phalangioides can easily catch and eat other spiders even those much larger than itself, such as ''[[Eratigena atrica]],''it’s other primary sources of nutrition generally includes ''[[mosquito]]es, other insects and woodlouse.'' During scarcity of food available they are also known to exhibit cannibalism.

=== Breeding ===
Peak breeding in this species occurs between June and September. The female holds the 20 to 30 eggs in her pedipalps. Spiderlings are transparent with short legs, and change their skin about 5 or 6 times as they mature.
==Venom==
'''''Pholcus phalangioides''''' rarely bites, most bites are followed by a short-lived burning sensation with a relatively low toxicity. The bites can occasionally lead to swellings and development of red patches on skin especially among young children.

== Ecological Importance ==

=== Relation with humans ===
They are considered beneficial in some parts of the world because they kill and eat other spiders, pests and disease-spreading insects such as mosquitoes and flies in addition to aranea species that can be considered a problem to humans such as hobo and redback spiders (although not fully confirmed).

=== Ecological threat ===
although useful to humans for pest eradication this species is becoming more common which could possibly lead to decline in the number of native species of flies, and other spiders. They may also be considered as being invasive and a great pest due to their messy-untidy cobwebs.

==Identification==
''Dolomedes minor'' is pale brown with some being grayish, like the rocks around which they live, helping to camouflage them against predators. (Arnqvist, 1992) The spider has large pedipalps, which are usually used for sensory purposes. The palps in the male ''Dolomedes minor'' are modified for putting sperm into the female's epigyne, which is located on the underside of the female's abdomen. The female ''Dolomedes minor'' can easily be identified based on this location of the epigyne. They possess large chelicerae, which are located just below the eyes. (Andrews, 1986) The spider has a body length of about 18 mm. The females are almost twice the size of the males. They move very fast and possess a long leg-span: over sixty millimeters for a fully grown female.
==Natural global range==
The family Pisauridae, containing all nursery web spiders, has been estimated to contain over 300 species. However, ''Dolomedes minor'' is the only species endemic to New Zealand.

This species is from the genus Dolomedes, the fishing spiders. This species of fishing spider is named after the mythological Greek god Triton who is the messenger of the big sea and the son of Poseidon.[1] These spiders can be seen scampering along the water’s surface when a person walks by in which they are often referred to as dock spiders because they are often witnessed as they quickly vanish through the cracks of a boat dock.
==Description==
This spider can be identified by its large size and distinctive markings. They have eight eyes with good vision and the body is grey to brown. They have a white to a pale cream colored stripe running down each side of the cephalothorax. The abdomen has many light colored spots and also has light colored lines running down the sides of the abdomen. When this species is seen from below, there are six dark spots present on the bottom of the cephalothorax in which the common name is derived.[1] Like many spiders, this species shows sexual dimorphism.[2] The female is larger than the male. The female is about 60 millimetres (2.4 in) long including the legs; her body length is 15–20 mm (0.59–0.79 in) and the male's body is 9–13 mm (0.35–0.51 in) long.[3] The juvenile spiders look similar to adults but are smaller and they go through a series of molts within their lifetime to grow and reach adult size.
==Distribution and habitat==
These spiders are native to the Western Hemisphere and can be found throughout the contiguous United States and southern Canada, more common east of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. They can also range into Mexico.[4] They are semi-aquatic and live in wetland habitats such as ponds, lake shores, and they can also inhabit slow-moving streams. They can be found among vegetation, rocks and other structures near the water such as boat docks.[4] They often dive underwater and grab onto a plant when frightened.

It is native to India and Sri Lanka.
==Description==
As usual in spider morphology, the female is much larger than male, where the female is about 8-9mm in total length and the male is 7-9mm in length.
==Ecology==
Heavy bodied jumper spiders can be seen commonly among foliage and within tree trunks. They construct oval, thick silken webs on the underside of leaves, such as the leaf spikes of coconut trees.[2] During the daytime, the sac is uninhabited, and when night falls, the male occupies the sac. But sometimes, it was found that the female also inhabited it on several nights.

'''''Phidippus clarus''''' is a species of jumping [[spider]] (family Salticidae) found in old fields throughout eastern North America. It often waits 

upside down near the top of a plant, which may be useful for detecting prey, and then quickly jumps down before the prey can escape. The spider is one of 60 species in the genus ''[[Phidippus]]'',:vii and one of about 5,000 in the [[Salticidae]], a family that accounts for about 10% of all spider species. Phidippus ''clarus'' is a predator, mostly taking insects, other spiders, and other terrestrial arthropods.

== Behavior ==
Like other jumping spiders, it has vision more acute than a cat and ten times more acute than a dragonfly. The eyes are used to locate prey and rivals, and find and court mates. All spiders have sensors for smell, taste, touch and vibration protruding through their cuticle ("skin"). Jumping spiders can leap up to 50 times their own length by powerfully extending the third or fourth pairs of legs, with the longer forelimbs extended to grasp the prey. ''P. clarus'', a relatively large salticid, takes prey up to the size of an adult earwig. In an experiment, ''P. clarus''was offered as many fruit flies as it could eat, and in four-hour sessions individuals took 17 flies on average – while one took 41.

=== Rivalry Habits ===
When ''P. clarus'' males compete for females, the winners are those that produce the most vibrations on the surface and those that are largest. Contests between females involve less displaying, and physical fights between females are more likely to end in injury or death. The most successful males choose the largest females, as these produce the most eggs and most quickly. If a female that has mated already then finds a larger male, she will often mate again with the larger male. The average clutch is 135 eggs. Unlike most of the genus ''Phidippus'', ''P. clarus'' females die after one brood has left the nest. ''P. clarus'' is parasitized by the Californian wasp ''[[Aporinellus completes]]'' and by mermithid nematodes. In an experiment in 2006, ''P. clarus'' showed promise for controlling the fourlined plant bug, ''[[Poecilocapsus lineatus]]'', which severely damages the commercially grown sweet basil.
==Morphology==
Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace and that of female ''Phidippus clarus'' average 4.05 millimetres (0.159 in) wide, while the carapaces of males average 3.20 millimetres (0.126 in). The differences among males and females are clearly noticable with the males being coated densely with black sensory hairs with an irregular red colored abdomen and a single black line passing through the red abdomen. They have a certain variety when it comes to the males the patterns on the abdomen can be different shades of Yellow, orange and scarlet with the same size and density of the single line, females on the other hand have their bodies coated with several shades of brown with irregular patterns on the thorax and the abdomen, Females also have an Eastern form with that one having a similar appearance to the males.
==Feeding==
Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, other spiders, and other non-aquatic arthropods. The most common procedure is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs to jump on the victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch. After capturing the prey, ''P. clarus'' settles in one spot and does not move again until it has discarded the undigestible hard remains of the prey. If ''P. clarus'' has gone without food for a few days, it eats slowly. ''P. clarus'', which is large by the standards of salticids, takes prey up to the size of an adult earwig. In an experiment, the jumping spider was offered as many fruit flies as it could eat, and in 4-hour sessions specimens took 17 flies on average—while one took. When the courtship display of wolf spider ''[[Schizocosa ocreata]]'' combines visual signals with vibrations, ''P. clarus'' responds to its wolf spider prey more quickly than when the wolf spider presents only one of the types of signal.
==Reproduction==
''Phidippus clarus'' becomes adult in early summer, and females about to lay eggs can weigh 400 milligrams (0.014 oz). Early in the breeding season, in early to mid-July, there are more males than females. The females all become sexually mature at the same time. At this point of the breeding season males die off, so that the number of males becomes equal to or slightly smaller than the number of females. By August, most females live in their nests overnight for increasing periods, as this is where they will lay eggs. The nests are located in rolled up leaves and are made of thick silk, which is expensive to build. The egg sacs are conspicuous, as they are made of such thick silk. Tests show that females use visual landmarks to return to their nests. A male only remains at the same nest when paired with a female. like other spiders and many other arthropods, ''P. clarus'' can vibrate surfaces to interact with others of its species, sometimes in conjunction with other communications such as movements, to intimidate rivals 

== Metamorphosis ==
The egg membrane is shed in 24–26 days, but the hatchlings (the first instar) continue to mature in the cocoon. The first molt occurs 24–28 days after the membrane is shed, and two to three days later the spiderlings leave their protective cover and become active, independent individuals. They do not hunt immediately, even if prey is available, but spend several hours engaged in apparently random activity before seeking cover, where they remain between two hours and two days. About 10% of spiderlings build retreats during this period, while the rest do so only after they have fed. The mothers usually die a few days after the spiderlings leave the nest.

Like other jumping spiders, it does not build a web. It uses its four pairs of large eyes to locate prey and its jumping ability to pounce and capture it. Zebra spiders are often noted for their awareness of humans. Upon noticing someone observing them, they can be seen raising their head, and usually change behavior (hence the name ''Salticus scenicus'', theatrical jumper).
==Description==
Female zebra spiders are 5-9 mm long and males are 5-6 mm.[1] The most distinctive feature of these spiders is their six very large eyes, which is typical for jumping spiders. Although they have eight eyes, the six at the front are the largest and give them excellent binocular vision. These tiny spiders are black with white hairs that form stripes.
==Behavior==
===Diet===
Zebra spiders tend to hunt smaller spiders and similar insects. They have been observed feeding on mosquitos that are almost twice their length. They have also been observed taking on prey items up to 3 times the length of the spider, such as some of the smaller species of moth. Like other jumping spiders, these spiders use their large front eyes to locate and stalk their prey. They move slowly towards their prey until they are close enough to pounce on top of their victim, and their hunting behavior has been described as cat-like. Using their acute eyesight, they are able to accurately judge the distances they need to jump.
===Hunting===
They orient towards prey detected by its lateral eyes whenever the angle subtended by such prey exceeds 5.5°. The velocity of the prey is not involved in the determination of reactive distance, but only moving objects elicit orientation. The probability that orientation is followed by stalking is a function of both prey size and velocity. The zebra spider's stalk velocity declines progressively as it nears its (stationary) prey.[2]

Before jumping, they glue a silk thread to the surface that they are jumping from so that if they miss the target, they can climb up the thread and try again - However, they may 'abseil' with a silk thread if they wish to descend from a height safely, for instance they have been documented 'abseiling' from ceilings. They ignore unappetizing insects such as ants.

There are no extensor muscles at the 'hinge joints' of the spider leg, instead joints extension is due to the haemocoelic blood pressure in the leg. The most significant evidence that this extension is due to hydraulic forces is that the leg spines become erect during the jump, a result of increased body pressure which can be demonstrated on many spiders. The zebra spider's jump is almost entirely due to the sudden straightening of the fourth pair of legs. The mean jumping velocity is estimated to be between 0.64–0.79 m/s (2.1–2.6 ft/s).
===Reproduction===
When these spiders meet, the male carries out a courtship dance involving waving his front legs and moving his abdomen up and down. The better the dance the more likely the female will want to mate, with success guaranteed if the male can exhibit a perfect shuffle.[citation needed] Females will stay with their egg sacs and will guard the young after they hatch. After the spiderlings have had their second molt they will leave the mother and fend for themselves.

In Spanish, it (and other South American recluse spiders) is known as araña de rincón, or "corner spider"; in Portuguese, as aranha-marrom or "brown spider". This spider is considered by many to be the most dangerous of the recluse spiders, and its bite is known to frequently result in severe systemic reactions, including death.
==Description==
The Chilean recluse is one of the larger species of recluse spiders, generally ranging from 8–40 mm in size (including legs). Like most recluses, it is brown and usually has markings on the dorsal side of its thorax, with a black line coming from it that looks like a violin with the neck of the violin pointing to the rear of the spider resulting in the nickname "fiddleback spider" or "violin spider" in English-speaking areas. Coloring varies from light tan to brown and the violin marking may not be visible. Since the "violin pattern" is not diagnostic, it is far more important, for purposes of identification, to examine the eyes. Most spiders have eight eyes, but recluse spiders have six eyes arranged in pairs (dyads) with one median pair and two lateral pairs.

Like other recluse spiders, the Chilean recluse builds irregular webs that frequently include a shelter consisting of disorderly threads. Unlike most web weavers, they leave these webs at night to hunt. People get bitten when they unintentionally squeeze them in clothing and bedding. These spiders frequently build their webs in woodpiles and sheds, closets, garages, and other places that are dry and generally undisturbed. The spider is frequently found in human dwellings. The spiders can last a long time without food or water,[1] a fact that encourages their worldwide spread.
==Habitat==
The Chilean recluse spider is native to South America. It is common in Chile, and can be found in Perú, Ecuador, Argentina, Uruguay, and south and eastern Brazil.[2][3]

It has been introduced into North and several Central American countries, but does not naturally thrive in those locations. The spider is known to have established itself in the Los Angeles area.[4] Infestations have been reported in the United States (Cambridge, Massachusetts, Florida), Canada (Vancouver, British Columbia) and Australia.[citation needed]

One colony of the spider is living in the Natural History Museum of Helsinki where it was probably introduced through fruit shipments in the 1960s and 1970s.[5] Local daycares, preschools and schools arrange daytrips here and parents are forewarned about the risk by required consent forms, although only one bite has ever been recorded.

==Description==
In the females of ''Micrommata ligurina'' the body length can reach 9–14 millimetres (0.35–0.55 in), while in the males it is about 6–9 millimetres (0.24–0.35 in).[4] The carapace is long and narrow and the abdomen is elongate. The cephalothorax and the long legs of the females are bright green, with a lighter green abdomen showing an almost indistinct median band. [4]

This spider is very similar to the green huntsman spider (''Micrommata virescens''), but the females have a black dot on the carapace. Moreover the adult males of 'M. ligurina'' have a dark brown median band on abdomen with whitish or gray sides. [4]

The eight eyes are arranged in two rows and surrounded by white hairs. Adults can be found in late winter and in early spring.
==Distribution==
''Micrommata ligurina'' occurs from the Mediterranean Basin to Central Asia. [1][2] The range of this species includes Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Malta, Portugal, Romania and Spain.

It has an elongate body, up to 11 mm (0.43 in) long, and adopts a straight line posture when alarmed. It lives on low vegetation in damp areas, and feeds on flying insects which it catches in its web.
==Description==
''T. extensa'' has an elongated, cream-colored body.[1] Males are smaller than females, at around 9 millimetres (0.35 in) body length, compared to 11 mm (0.43 in) for females.[2] The four pairs of legs are very long,[1] and are dark yellow.[3] The carapace, which is around 1.8–2.6 mm long and 1.1–1.7 mm wide, is orange or dark yellow.

The coloring of ''T. extensa'' is quite variable,[4] ranging from creamy-yellow to green.[2] On the underside, there is a thick black central band, with a silvery band on either side.[3]

''T. extensa'' is distinguished from other members of the genus ''Tetragnatha'' by the minute curved tip of the male's conductor (part of the pedipalp), and the form of the female's spermatheca.
==Distribution==
''T. extensa'' has a wide distribution across the Northern Hemisphere (Holarctic).

In North America, it is found from Alaska to Newfoundland, and its range extends south to Washington, Colorado and Pennsylvania.[3] The species has a broad ecological range, having been found at the tree line in the Rocky Mountains.

It is found in coastal vegetation in Europe.[3] ''T. extensa'' is found throughout the United Kingdom,[2] where it is the commonest species of ''Tetragnatha'',[4] and one of the commonest spiders.[1] It is also found in Madeira.

Koch in 1835, belonging to the order [[Araneae]], family Thomisidae. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek root xyst, meaning "scraped, scraper".
==Distribution==
The genus ''Xysticus'' is distributed almost worldwide, but has not been recorded from South America. Of the about 360 species of the genus currently described, about 71 are present in Europe.
==Description==
''Xysticus'' and ''[[Coriarachne]]'' are dark brown or reddish-brown crab spiders often encountered on weeds or trees. While similar to the 'flower spiders', they tend to have shorter, sturdier legs. Many, but not all, species have abdomens more patterned than most ''[[Thomisus]]'' species, rather like some of the ''[[Synema]]'' species. Some however, that are more terrestrial, resemble earth in color and texture.

Most species of the genus ''Xysticus'' are small to medium sized spiders. They show a sexual dimorphism in size. Females of typical species reach a maximum of 10 millimetres (0.39 in) of body length, while their males are about 3–5 millimetres (0.12–0.20 in) long, about half the size of the females.

The basic color of these species is usually brown, beige or gray. The prosoma is sometimes slightly smaller than the opisthosoma. In many species the front body shows in the middle a broad, pale longitudinal band. The opisthosoma is clearly flattened in most species and shows a median broad and dark leaf marking.

The species are often very similar to each other, and in most cases can be distinguished only by a microscopic examination of the reproductive organs.

Common names include the '''feather-legged lace weaver''' and the '''garden centre spider''', the latter name being due to its frequent occurrence of this spider in garden centres on the world. The species name is derived from the Latin pluma "feather" and pes "foot".

Females grow up to 6 mm. They lack venom glands, and are therefore non-venomous. A stabilimentum is sometimes present. Pattern and coloration is quite variable. In contrast to ''[[Uloborus walckenaerius]]'', it has distinct tufts of hairs on the front legs. They are well-camouflaged as they hang upside down motionlessly in their horizontal webs. Young spiders look like dead insects and are thus hard to find on a web. The empty egg sac can often be seen attached to house plants. It is flattish, papery and brown and about 0.5 cm long, with the shape of a dried holly leaf.
==Description==
''Uloborus plumipes'' is a small spider with adult females growing to a length of about 6 mm (0.2 in). The abdomen is truncated and patterned with various irregular tubercles and granulations. The front pair of legs are uneven in appearance with the tibia clothed in dense hairs while the naked terminal segments are very slender. The color is some shade of greyish-brown mottled with white specks.
==Distribution and habitat==
''Uloborus plumipes'' originated from warmer parts of the Old World where its typical habitat is on the trunk or among dead twigs and branches of trees.[1] It has spread to Holland, Belgium and other parts of Europe where it is found in heated greenhouses. It was first recorded in the United Kingdom in 1992 and has since spread to many areas particularly in the south and east. It is often known as the garden centre spider because it is found on houseplants growing in hothouses in garden centres and is able to survive the winter in greenhouses that are heated to maintain a temperature well above freezing point. It may perform a useful function in helping to control [[whitefly]].

species of arachnid from the family [[Theridiidae]] residing in the Hawaiian islands.  Theridion grallator occurs in a wide range of polymorphisms, and also possesses a unique ability to temporarily change their exoskeleton’s colour respectively to various food items they consume.

== Morphology ==
With a size of less than 6 mm,  Theridion grallator is a minuscule, translucent lemon-yellow coloured spider with the hairy, thin needle-like fore and hind appendages being almost twice the body length. The main striking feature of  Theridion grallator is the pattern present on the abdomen, varying amongst one morph to another, the patters on their abdomens resemblance a smiling face hence the name happy face spider. The generals polymorphism consists of a difference in the patterns present on the abdomen varying from one specimen to another generally composed of irregular, black red and white patterns often resembling a grinning face. The coloration of their abdomen varies from lime green, lime, orange, vermillion, white or sulphur depending on their diet. 

== Life cycle ==

=== Reproduction ===
Female’s pregnancy lasts for a few weeks after completion. The female deposits an egg sac containing upto 250 eggs. The female loosens the silk encasing the eggs when they are about to hatch letting our baby  Theridion grallators. The female guards the eggs until they emerge.

=== Infants ===
The female remains within the close proximity of her young and feeds them as the spiderlings are unable to hunt for themselves. She encases prey in silk strings and traps them allowing her young to consume them. The females are not observed to consume anything during this stage.

==== Brood Adoption ====
upon the death of their parents young spiders may join another species of adult  Theridion grallator on the closest residential leaf. Females are often known to adopt orphaned, young  Theridion grallators.

== Feeding habits ==
This spider is known to camouflage amongst its surroundings. They do not built webs but rather wait for prey. They feed on long legged flies ( [[Dolichopodidae]] ) and cosmopolitan flies ([[Drosphilidae]])

=== Hunting ===
Theridion grallator detects the presence of prey via vibrations occurring on the residential leaf and are exceptionally capable of identifying prey or predators using vibrations. They built untidy, minuscule webs often messy or tangled.

== Geological distribution ==
They have been found on the islands of O’ahu, Moloka’i, Maui, generally in humid, moisture rich tropical to subtropical forests with an average rainfall between 200-360 mm. They reside on the underside of leaves of the Kanawao plant.

[[File:076BA7BF-F069-4CC9-B208-07ECBBA85466.jpeg|thumb|Adult female]]

== Morphology ==
A very gorgeous species with a striking resemblance to [[Nephila|Golden orb weaver]] spiders. Females can be as large as 25 cm in length, males never exceed more than 11 cm in length. The adults have a bright, golden coloured abdomen along with black stripes and dashes of bright scarlet along the lower abdominal region with bodies speckled with bright yellow, the bands may either be navy blue or Matt black. Their heads are silver-grey and have long, rigid appendages banded with bright yellow or gold. Their webs are a uniquely golden coloured and may reach several metres in size, the beautiful species builds subtle, iridescent webs, the webs are intricate and incredibly tough; rigid. 

== Life Cycles ==
The female lays an egg sac consisting of 400-1500 babies, laid on trees during mid-autumn, coupling occurs during earlier days of autumn. The females dies by early winters or shortly after laying eggs. The eggs hatch in spring. The nymphs are very small, golden in colour and resemblance bears that of ticks.

== Behaviour ==

=== Diet ===
This spiders eats small insects trapped in its intricate networks of strings, it liquifies them and wraps the carcass in silk cocoons. This beauty is an invasive species. 

=== Aggression ===
Aggression occurs in females during mid autumn, they are usually docile and shy of humans, they are however territorial during breeding seasons, only the females can pierce human skin. The bite is painful without doubt but their venom is ineffective on humans.

== The Jorogumo ==
The jorogumo is a half-human half-joro spider, she can disguise herself as a beautiful woman to seduce men to her den and devour them, she avoids mirrors as her reflection can reveal her true form. She inhabits the forests and urbanisations. It is said that a Joro spider becomes a jorogumo if she reaches 400 years old.

== Morphology ==
Archaeidae species have a striking characteristic of long “necks” joint to the [[Cephalothorax]], The long neck-like structures help Archaeidae species keep the prey at arm’s length. These spiders have long, thin appendages. In terms of size and body mass the length of most species ranges from 2-8 mm (roughly the length of a grain of rice). The common name “'''Pelican Spider'''” is highly appropriate for Archaeidae, as they possess long, thick mandibles resembling that of of a pelican’s beak. The long mandibles are thicker towards the bottom yet thinner at the base. 

== Behaviour ==

=== Hunting ===
Archaeidae spiders prey exclusively on other species of spiders. They are known to hunt instead of utilising webs. Using their thin, elongated appendages. These spiders walk silently and “assassinate” other spiderwebs, hence the name '''assassin spiders''' due to their silent hunting patterns. Upon attacking the prey, assassin spiders release sharp, poison-laced fangs from the tips of their mandibles holding the prey upright to prevent an escape, they continue to liquify their prey by pumping large amounts of toxins into their bodies.

These mites live in tropical and sub-tropical regions but somehow got transported to parts of North America. ''Brevipalpus phoenicis'' has been located in many locations such as Central America, Oceania, Africa, South America, and parts of the U.S. This species of mite has been a pest to crops since the beginning of the 20th century. They have been known to transmit the citrus leprosis virus to plants. 

== Life cycle ==
The [[egg]]s are deposited singly, but close to the same female in cracks, crevices, and holes. The eggs are reddish orange and have a tail-like projection. After the eggs hatch, they become [[larva|larvae]] The larva are bright orange to red with six legs. After the larva stage is done, they become [[nymph]]s. They have 2 nymphal stages, protonymph and deutonymph. The protonymph is larger than the larvae and does have 8 legs. The deutonymph is similar, except it has an extra pair of legs. After these two nymphal stages, it becomes an adult. The adult has all 8 legs and is an opaque orange color.

They are in the subfamily Tydeinae of the family Tydeidae. Commonly found on the foliage of citrus trees around the world, ''Lorryia formosa'' also associates with a variety of other plant types. The life cycle includes six discrete stages of development, and the lifespan averages about 37 days. The females of the species use an asexual form of reproduction where the growth and development of embryos occurs without fertilization by a male, a process called thelytoky.
==Taxonomy==
''Lorryia formosa'', originally found in Morocco, was first described by Cooreman in 1958.[2] In his 1980 revision of the family Tydeidae, H.M. André synonymized the genus ''Lorryia'' with ''Tydeus'', and ''Lorryia formosa'' became ''Tydeus formosus''.[3] André based his revision on the similarities of the chaetotaxy, especially on the legs, but ignored body ornamentation, which is a major character used by other authors. In 1998, Kazmierski revised the Tydeinae subfamily, this time using ornamentation and other features, and reestablished the genus ''Lorryia''.
==Description==
In ''Lorryia formosa'', like all Acariformes mites, the capitulum is the head segment and the idiosoma is the body segment. The idiosoma is further subdivided into the propodosoma, metapodosoma, and opisthosoma. The Tydeinae subfamily, to which ''Lorryia formosa'' belongs, is characterized by having three pairs of lyrifissures (grooves that encircle the surface of an appendage) and a pair of primitive eyes (oculi) which commonly occur laterally on the propodosoma, the middle body segment to which the first two pairs of legs are attached. The genital region includes a progenital aperture flanked by setae. Specimens are generally less than 250 µm long.

'''''Ophionyssus natricis''''' or '''Reptile [[mite]]''' is a parasitic mite most commonly found on snakes, but also occurring on captive lizards, turtles, crocodiles and other reptiles.[1] The parasites feed on snakes, which cause the bodies of the mites to be engorged with blood and fluids from the snake. Once the mites feed by puncturing through the snake skin, the snake usually shows symptoms of irritation and discomfort. Also this provides a point of entry where diseases from Aeromonas spp. and Inclusion Body Disease (IBD) can be transmitted. Mites have also been shown to act as vectors for IBD. The pathology for disease transmission by the mites is still unknown. Human infestation has been reported.
==Morphology==
The larvae are pale white. They either stay pale ivory or yellow if unfed in the protonymph stage. The mites will turn a dark red if feeding does occur. After feeding, the mites have a soft body that is dark red or black in color and noticeable legs that can be seen by the human eye during the deutonymph stage.

As adults, male mites are smaller than their female counterparts. The colors can range from dark yellowish-brown, dark red or black depending on the feeding of the mite onto the snake. Female adults, however, are big, fat, and black mites. They weigh 50 μg, but can weigh 750 μg if fully engorged from the blood meal.
==Life cycle==
There are five life stages for the snake mite: egg, larva, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. The intermediate stages (larva, protonymph, and deutonymph) must shed at least once to progress into the next stage. The ideal conditions in the environment for the mite to fully develop into a parasite are at temperatures between 75–85 °F (24–29 °C) and a relative humidity of 70%–90%. The life stages can be completed usually in 13 to 19 days.

Unfavorable conditions in the environment will cause impairment of development and survivorship at all stages of the mites. Mites are killed at all stages when exposed to temperatures above 105 °F (41 °C) or below 35 °F (2 °C) for several days. In terms of humidity, the mites will desiccate at levels below 20%. The mites will also drown if they are wet.

Females can lay a dozen or two eggs at a time (60 to 80 in a lifetime). The eggs are usually laid in dark and humid areas. They are rarely laid on the snake where the adult mites are found. Eggs will hatch in one day in ideal conditions.

After hatching, the young mites go through the larval stage, which takes about one or two days. The larvae tend to move very little away from the eggs, despite having the ability to walk.

The larvae progress next into the protonymph stage, which can last three days to two weeks. At this stage, the protonymphs become attracted to the smell of snakes and require a blood meal from the snakes to go into the next stage. The protonymphs will tend to walk around the scale surfaces and head plates of the snake.

The deutonymph stage then takes place after the blood meal at a place usually away from the snake. Shedding takes about a day to become adult mites. At the adult stage, the mites will continue to feed on the snake host until the males mate with female that is not engorged. Adult mites usually live up to 40 days.

There are only 3 families and 130 species of whip-spiders. The order of whip-spiders is [[Amblypygi]]. 

== Appearance ==
These rare and beautiful  arachnids have flattened bodies and a broad [[cephalothorax]]. The [[pedipalp]]s can be long, slender, or short, and possibly sharp depending on the species. The [[tarsus|tarsi]] are sharp. The pedipalps hold prey, while the arachnid's [[chelicerae]] tear apart the prey. The pair of front limbs are spectacularly modified for holding and stabbing prey simultaneously. They are not venomous. A beautiful arachnid rare to see. 

== Life cycle ==
Males drop a [[spermatophore]] on the ground, where they are picked up by a female's [[genitalia]]. Females carry around their [[egg]]s and the young hatch in a brood sack. The young are pale white to light brown or beige in colour and turn darker with each molt.

== Behaviour ==

=== Mobility and Hunting ===
they use 6 legs for walking, the frontal pair is larger that the legs, thicker and is adorned with sharp spikes, the front legs are slightly hooked at the ends and are usually held straight to each other folded in a V shape. When hunting their frontal legs jab at their prey and grab them whilst the prey is pierced by their fangs. They move in a sidewalk (crab-like).

== Feeding habits ==
All whip-spiders are [[predacious]]. They feed on centipedes, spiders and other cave dwelling insects such as beetles.

== [[Insect habitat|Habitat]] ==
Whip-spiders favor tropical and sub-tropical areas. They are also known to be ground dwellers and may also inhabit caves.

Amblypygi is in the wide range of Arachnids, which is a family of [[Asilidae|spiders]], [[Buthidae|scorpions]], [[Uropygi|whip scorpions]], and [[Thrips|mites]].

Amblypygi normally can be from a few inches long to as long as 7 inches in lengt (larger species Like [[whip-spider]] normally live in Arizona) and even through they deliver painful bites, These beauties lurk within caves especially humid, limestone caves and may also be ground dwelling arachnids. They are beautiful and have varying appearances, commonly known as tailless whip scorpions they’re beautiful arachnids inhabiting equatorial, deciduous and rainforest in Africa, Australia, New Zealand etc.

==Appearances==
The body of '''P. marginemaculatus''' can measure up to 18 millimetres (0.71 in) long, but its front legs can reach 100 millimetres (3.9 in) long. It has eight pairs of legs with six used for walking and the first employed as sensory organs for detecting prey and navigating their environment. Its cephalothorax is wider than it is long and is outfitted with eight eyes. One pair of eyes is located in front and 3 more pairs on the sides. They produce no venom, but instead have arm-like pedipalps and a pair of smaller chelicerae.
==Behavior==
''P. marginemavulatus'' use 3 pairs of ambulatory legs to move sideways as a crab would and 1 pair for sensory purposes. They capture prey using, arm-like pedipalps. ''P. marginemaculatus'' engage in agonistic interactions, where opponents use a series of displays.

==Description==
''Ornithodoros hermsi'' is a soft-bodied tick of the family Argasidae. It is one of the smallest ticks of the species ''[[Ornithodoros]]''.[2] Females are larger than the males.[3] ''O. hermsi'' has a multihost lifecycle,[1] and some females have been observed to live four years without any blood meals.[3] They are parasites of rodents and other small mammals. The most favored host is the western chipmunk, ''Eutamias'' spp.
==Lifecycle==
As do all other species of ticks, ''O. hermsi'' begin as eggs, then larvae, then nymphs, to adult ticks.[4] ''O. hermsi'' has two larval molts and three nymphal stages.[5] The nymphal blood meals and the greater volume of blood intake will increase the development from nymphs to adults and decrease the number of nymphal stages.

Dust mites feed on organic detritus, such as flakes of shed human skin, and flourish in the stable environment of dwellings. House dust mites are a common cause of asthma and allergic symptoms worldwide. The mite's gut contains potent digestive enzymes (notably proteases) that persist in their feces and are major inducers of allergic reactions such as wheezing. The mite's exoskeleton can also contribute to allergic reactions. The European house dust mite (''Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus'') and the American house dust mite (''Dermatophagoides farinae'') are two different species, but are not necessarily confined to Europe or North America; a third species ''Euroglyphus maynei'' also occurs widely. Unlike scabies mites or skin follicle mites, house dust mites do not burrow under the skin and are not parasitic.
==Description==
House dust mites, due to their very small size and translucent bodies, are barely visible to the unaided eye.[2] A typical house dust mite measures 0.2–0.3 millimetres (0.008–0.012 in) in length.[3] For accurate identification, one needs at least 10× magnification.[citation needed] The body of the house dust mite has a striated cuticle.
==Life cycle==
The average life cycle for a male house dust mite is 10–19 days. A mated female house dust mite can last up to 70 days, laying 60 to 100 eggs in the last 5 weeks of her life. In a 10-week life span, a house dust mite will produce approximately 2,000 fecal particles and an even larger number of partially digested enzyme-covered dust particles.

==Description==
Spider mites are less than 1 millimetre (0.04 in) in size and vary in color. They lay small, spherical, initially transparent eggs and many species spin silk webbing to help protect the colony from predators; they get the "spider" part of their common name from this webbing.
==Life cycle==
Hot, dry conditions are often associated with population build-up of spider mites. Under optimal conditions (approximately 80 °F or 27 °C), the two-spotted spider mite can hatch in as little as 3 days, and become sexually mature in as little as 5 days. One female can lay up to 20 eggs per day and can live for 2 to 4 weeks, laying hundreds of eggs. This accelerated reproductive rate allows spider mite populations to adapt quickly to resist pesticides, so chemical control methods can become somewhat ineffectual when the same pesticide is used over a prolonged period.[3]

Spider mites, like hymenopterans and some [[scale insect]]s, are arrhenotochous: females are diploid and males are haploid.[4] When mated, females avoid the fecundation of some eggs to produce males. Fertilized eggs produce diploid females. Unmated, unfertilized females still lay eggs, that originate exclusively haploid males.

==The physical appearance==
During late spring and summer, tubular growths up to 5 millimetres (0.20 in) long develop on the upper surface of lime tree leaves. These galls may be yellow-green or red in color, may be very numerous, and predominantly occur on the lower leaves in some sub-species.
==Taxonomy==
Several sub-species have been identified, partly identified by their positioning on the leaves in relation to the veins and other structures.

They are extremely small with adults measuring up to one millimeter in length and only have four legs at the front of the body. Viewing by the human eye requires, a 10 – 20X lens. The adult mites are usually yellow but also have been seen to be white or orange. The cereal rust mite was first found on ''Elymus repens'' (couch grass), a very common perennial grass species. It has now been found on more than 60 grass species including oats, barley, wheat and ryegrass, found in Europe, North America, South Africa and Australia. Mites migrate primarily through wind movement and are usually found on the highest basal sections of the top two leaf blades.''A bacarus hystrix'' produces up to twenty overlapping generations per year in South Australian perennial pastures, indicating that the species breeds quite rapidly. It has been noted that the cereal rust mite can cause losses in yield of up to 30-70%.
==Life cycle==
Cereal rust mite eggs are exceptionally small and are placed in leaf vein grooves by the mite.[1] The eggs usually begin hatching at the beginning of spring (March in the Northern Hemisphere and September in the Southern Hemisphere) and once they have reached the juvenile stage, the mites mature very quickly (16–18 days). Once the mites are at the adult stage they often travel to the lower section of the plant where they feed on young tissues. Mites are always present for the full growing season of the plant, but activity has been seen to decrease as the temperature begins to rise, this is because unlike other mite species the cereal rust mite favors much cooler temperatures.
==Impacts of mite on grasses==
''Abacarus hystrix'' is a vector for two viruses (Agropyron mosaic and Ryegrass mosaic) and also causes direct damage to the leaf. The effect of the Ryegrass Mosaic Virus (RMV) which is only transmitted by this mite, is chlorotic streaks on the leaves. When the mite feeds on grooves of the leaf surface, it prefers the large cells on the smooth bottom of the groove as opposed to the more ridged, small cells of the side walls. Mite feeding causes direct damage to the leaves, which can be noticed as discoloration or “rusting” of the leaf.

''D. folliculorum'' is one of the parasitic/commensal face mites that occur on people (the other one is ''[[Demodex brevis]]'').[1][2] When large numbers of ''D. folliculorum'' are found on humans, the infestation is known as demodicosis.
==History==
''Demodex canis'' was first discovered in 1840 to cause mange in dogs. Tulk was the first to publish about ''Demodex'' in dogs. In 1842, a Frenchman named Berger discovered ''Demodex folliculorum'' in earwax.
==Behavior==
These mites are found in human hair follicles, normally found in greater numbers around the cheeks, nose, eyebrows, eyelashes, and forehead. They could also be found in other parts of the body such as arms, chest, and ears. It is a species of tiny mites that have been thought to contribute to hair loss (though this hypothesis is under debate)[5] and lives in pores and hair follicles. The mites vary in size from 0.1 mm to 0.4 mm long.[6] Mites do not invade internal organs. Under normal conditions, they are not harmful, and classified as commensals (the mite benefits but there is no harm or benefit to the host) rather than parasites (where the host is harmed), though under outbreak conditions (demodicosis) they can be harmful.

==Biological Description==
At maturity, mites are yellowish orange in colour, with females ranging from 0.19-0.26 mm in length with the males slightly smaller at, 0.165-0.180 mm.[4] Except for genitalia male and female mites are externally similar. Larvae are smaller than the adults and distinguished by a humpback and exhibit no external genitalia. Eggs are soft, round, 0.04mm in diameter and at first colorless but later light orange. Mite growth and development is dependent on environmental and climatic conditions.[5] ''A. chondrillae'' have an average generation cycle of 10 days
==Impact on Chondrilla==
The chondrilla plant exhibits galls when infested by ''A. chondrillae''. These galls appear as clusters of tiny, hyperplastic buds[5] reaching a size of 1.5–2 cm in diameter, and in some cases up to 5 cm.[6] Hundreds of mites can be contained within each gall.

The development of the galls impede the health, growth, and reproduction abilities of the plant by:
*destroying the flower buds in gall formation, reducing and suppressing seed production.
*compromising the apical shoots, resulting in a diminished regenerative capacity. Particularly efficacious in plants infested early, gall formations block shoot development on the apical growing points, stunting growth, distorting adjacent stems, associated foliage and in some cases causing death.
*weakening the plant through the presence and production of large galls. The plant often turns yellow early from premature decline.[3][5][7]

''A. chondrillae'' has been recognized to affect plants of the ''Chondrilla'' genus: ''C. juncea'', ''C. juncea f. acantholepis'', ''C. brevirostris'' and ''C. leiosperma''.

The mite is found in all parts of the world. Humans are not the only mammals that can become infected. Other mammals, such as wild and domesticated dogs and cats (in which it is one cause of mange) as well as ungulates, wild boars, bovids, wombats, koalas, and great apes are affected.[1]

The discovery of the itch mite in 1687 marked scabies as the first disease of humans with a known cause.[2] The Italian biologist Diacinto Cestoni showed in the 18th century that scabies is caused by the mite ''Sarcoptes scabiei'', variety hominis. The disease produces intense, itchy skin rashes when the impregnated female tunnels into the stratum corneum of the skin and deposits eggs in the burrow. The larvae, which hatch in three to 10 days, move about on the skin, moult into a nymphal stage, and then mature into adult mites. The adult mites live three to four weeks in the host's skin.
==Clinical significance==
The action of the mites moving within the skin and on the skin itself produces an intense itch that may resemble an allergic reaction in appearance. A delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mites, their eggs, or scybala (packets of feces) occurs approximately 30 days after infestation. The presence of the eggs produces a massive allergic response that, in turn, produces more itching. Individuals who already are sensitized from a prior infestation can develop symptoms within hours.

''Sarcoptes'' is a genus of skin parasites, and part of the larger family of mites collectively known as "scab mites". They are also related to the scab mite ''Psoroptes'', also a mite that infests the skin of domestic animals. Sarcoptic mange affects domestic animals and similar infestations in domestic fowls causes the disease known as "scaly leg". The effects of ''S. scabiei'' are the most well-known, causing "scabies", or "the itch". The adult female mite, having been fertilized, burrows into the skin (usually at the hands or wrists, but other parts of the body may also be affected), and lays its eggs.

The burrowing is carried out using the mouth parts and special cutting surfaces on the front legs. While these are being used, the mite anchors itself with suckers on its feet. Eggs are laid in small numbers as the mite burrows, and, as these hatch, six-legged larvae climb out on to the skin and search for hair follicles, where they feed and moult (discard old cuticles to grow). In the hair follicles, the larvae show the first nymphal stages, with eight legs.

In the nymphal stages, the creature feeds and moults, and if male, gives rise to the adult. In the case of females, another moult occurs before adulthood. The female has more moults than a male, so takes longer — 17 days compared to 9 to 11 days for a male — to reach adulthood. The female is about twice the size of the male.

The eggs are laid by the female at a rate of about two to three eggs a day for about two months. About 2% of the British population is thought to be infected with these mites, which take about 25 minutes to an hour to burrow into the skin.[citation needed]

The best conditions in which to harbor ''S. scabiei'' is in areas with frequent skin-to-skin contact, such as the hands and wrists, as the mites are transmitted by skin contact with carriers, and they very easily spread. Infestations of ''S. scabiei'' are commonly found in pigs. They significantly depress growth and feeding rate, but usually die out in around five days in typical farm conditions. However, once in a herd, the mites are very difficult to eliminate without great measures taken.
==Morphology==
Adult scabies mites are spherical, eyeless mites with four pairs of legs (two pairs in front and two pairs behind).[3] They are recognizable by their oval, ventrally flattened and dorsally convex tortoise-like bodies and multiple cuticular spines.[4] No demarcation into cephalothorax or abdomen occurs, and the mite's surface has folds covered with short bristles. The front legs end in long, tubular processes known as suckers, and the hind legs end in long bristles. The male has suckers on all legs except the third pair, which distinguishes it from the female. Females are 0.3–0.45 mm (0.012–0.018 in) long and 0.25–0.35 mm (0.0098–0.0138 in) wide, and males are just over half that size.

Characterized as the “bite and run” parasite, the first reported case of ''Cheyletiella Yasguri'' was in Italy in the year of 1965.[1] It is named after Dr. I. Yasgur.[2] It has been found throughout the world with reported cases in the Italy, Germany, The Netherlands, the U.S. etc. A distinguishable characteristic that sets species ''C. yasguri'' apart from the others is the morphology of the sensory organ in the legs. The mite contains two lobes compared to the species ''C. parasitivorax'' which only contains one.[3] ''Cheyletiella Yasguri'' causes irritation and inflammation of the skin (Dermatitis) usually as a result of allergic reaction. Young pups are most vulnerable and conditions can be mild to very severe. This mite resides in the outer layer of the skin (keratin) and does most of its feeding on the liquid substance of tissue.[4] They do not dig into the skin and do not replicate.
==Diagnosis==
In order to diagnose the condition, samples of the skin or fur must be further examined under a microscope. Other techniques used to diagnose the condition include deep scraping of the skin and removal of samples with the use of tape.[6] Because symptoms are often similar those of Scabies, an accurate diagnosis would be under a microscope.
==Transmission==
It is highly transmittable especially through physical contact. Humans are also prone to becoming infested with mites. If contact with pet is cut off completely symptoms will disappear after a short amount of time because the parasites do not replicate on humans. Common infested areas in humans vary from the chest, abdomen, arms, and buttocks. Common infestation areas in dogs include the neck, back, and tail. Results can be anything from lesions of the skin, severe itching, and sometimes the condition will go unnoticed in dogs.

The mite parasitizes a variety of insect hosts and bites humans, causing red, itchy, and painful wheals (welts). The mites are barely visible, measuring about 0.2 millimeters; their great reproductive potential, small size, and high capacity for dispersal by wind make them difficult to control or avoid.
==Life cycle==
Newly emerged and mated females inject a neurotoxin-containing saliva into their hosts, which paralyzes the host and enables the gravid female mites to feed on the host's hemolymph.[1] The posterior portion (opisthosoma) of the female enlarges as its progeny develops inside, and, within a few days, up to 250 adult mites emerge from the gravid female.[1] Bruce and Wrensch (1990) found that progeny of the straw itch mite averaged 254 offspring of which 92% were females. Males emerge before the females, position themselves around the mother's genital opening, and mate with emerging females.[1] Then, mated females disperse to find new hosts.[1] These mites often are dispersed by wind, and when they land on vertebrate hosts, they attempt to feed, resulting in the bites.[1] A life cycle can be completed within seven days, and progeny emergence can be extended to 15 days.[1]

The mites' reported hosts have included ''Anobium punctatum'', the pink bollworm, ''Grapholita molesta'', ''Tineola bisselliella'', ''Apis cerana'' (Asiatic honey bee), periodic [[cicada]]s, and various pests of stored grain, as well as humans and their pets.[2][3][4] Their usual hosts in the United States are oak midge larvae.[2] Conditions that are cooler and moister than average favor its population growth. Outbreaks of attacks on humans in the United States have been attributed to fluctuations in the supply of oak midge larvae.
==Distribution==
''P. herfsi'' has been recorded in Czechoslovakia,[5] Egypt,[6] Australia,[7] northern India,[8] and the United States. It is a regulated pest in Germany.

A pest of several species of palm in the Middle East and South East Asia, it is now becoming established throughout the Caribbean. The invasion of this species is the biggest mite explosion ever observed in the Americas.
==Distribution==
This species is indigenous to Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Mauritius, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Réunion, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.

It is considered an invasive species in Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Trinidad and Tobago, the US Virgin Islands, Granada, Haiti and Jamaica.[2]

In 2007, the red palm mite was discovered in Florida. As of April, 2009, this pest has been found at almost 400 sites in five counties there.
==Description==
This species can be distinguished from most other mites by its colour, flat body, long spatulate setae, and droplets on the dorsal body setae. There is also a noticeable absence of the webbing associated with numerous other [[spider mite]]s.

The red palm mite has a long, bright red, spatulate body. During all stages of life, this species is red, with adult females often showing black patches on their backs after feeding.

Red palm mite eggs are 0.12 mm long and 0.09 wide. The eggs are smooth and can be found in groups attached to the underside of leaves.[2]

Larvae are 0.18–.020 mm in length and only have three pairs of legs. Nymphs are 0.18–0.25 mm long.

Adults are approximately 0.32 mm long. Females are larger than males and have a triangular body.

Together with the related species ''T. longior'', it is commonly referred to as the '''mold mite'''[1] or the '''[[cheese mite]]'''.
==Ecology==
In the wild, ''T. putrescentiae'' occurs throughout the world in a wide range of habitats, including "grasslands, old hay, mushrooms, and the nest of bees and ducks".[1] Under ideal conditions, with temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) and humidity above 85%, it can complete its life cycle in under three weeks.[1]

It is a common pest of stored products, especially those with a high protein and fat content (meat, cheese, nuts and seeds, dried eggs, etc.).[1] It feeds on the fungi that grow on the foodstuffs, and can become a pest of mycology laboratories.
==Human health==
''Tyrophagus putrescentiae'' has been identified as the cause of human disease in different regions. It has been found to cause copra itch among people who handle copra in the tropics, skin and respiratory allergies among people handling raw hams in Italy, and dermatitis in an Austrian butcher's shop.

It is an [[ectoparasite]] of birds specifically poultry but may also parasitize humans. 

== Appearance ==
''D. gallinae'' is minute sized organisms with a translucent ghostly-white carapace and yellow limbs with sizes below 1/32 of an inch. The antennae are mainly composed of 5 or more segments with a limb's composition being 4-6 segments each. Their bodies become enlarged and obtain a burnished-blood red colored carapace after feeding.  

== Behavior ==
D. Gallinae is certainly shows high rates of '''Hematophagy''' and Parasitsm. The most common infestation occurs during night-time oung birds are most susceptible. The mites can also affect the health of the birds indirectly, as they may serve as vectors for diseases such as Salmonellosis, avian spirochaetosis and ''Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae''.

=== Suitable conditions ===
''D. gallinae'' can survive for up to 10 months in an empty hen house, temperatures greater than 45 °C (113 °F) and less than −20 °C (−4 °F), have been found to be lethal.

=== Feeding habits ===
D. Gallinae will use their powerful legs to attach themselves to a new host (Mainly Poultry birds or mammals) Afterwards, They will use their long chelcirate to penetrate through the skin of the host animal and parasitize them and drain them blood which causes teir bodies to inflate and attain a new blood-red appearance. The mites are capable of digesting and reproducing entirely on human blood, so infestations can be persistent. Due to the nocturnal feeding habits of ''D. gallinae'', infested people may experience itching and notice bites when they wake up in the morning. The severity of symptoms vary, with dermatitis, pruritus and papular urticaria being common.

== Life Cycle ==
After laching onto a host and draining them of body fluids, the adult female will conceal itself in cracks and crevices, where she will give birth to several [[egg]]s. If the life cycle is carried under favourable conditions of this species, the life cycle could be finished in 7 days. They undergo 4 stages, Larva, Protonymph, Nymphal stage and Adult. Molts will occur each time after feeding. 

== Control ==
''D. gallinae'' can live up to 10 months in an empty henhouse, so it is important to clean your henhouses thoroughly. Design henhouses so that you can eliminate hiding spots. Chemicals, if used should be sprayed in rotation to avoid build up. [[wikipedia:Cresote|Cresote]] treatment of wood will also kill these mites, and keep them away from the area for some time.

* Heating the henhouse to temperatures above 55 °C (131 °F).
* Regular washing down of the housing system.
* Treatment of the walls and floors with silica dust or carbolineum prior to introduction of the new hens.

In seals, the mites can be both prevalent (almost every single seal has them) and abundant (more than 1000 mites per seal). Although clinical observations and gross examination indicate that ''O. attenuata'' parasitization alone is not serious, some erosion and inflammation of the nasal turbinates and nasopharynx in seals has been observed in histological sections.[1] If concomitant parasitization with ''O. attenuata'' and ''O. diminuta'' occurs, alveolar emphysema and more serious ailments can threaten the life of the mammal.
==Morphology==
Mature mites are shown to be elongated in the posterior part of body to form a club-shape with the rounded posterior extremity. Ten to twelve transverse rows of 8 to 12 sharp denticles and a few rows of minute spines are present on the ventral surface of the capitulum and the posterior surface of coxa III, respectively.
==Transmission==
The usual mode of host-to-host transmission by ''Orthohalarachne'' is thought to be accomplished by active larvae that crawl or are sneezed from one animal to another. Both males and females are relatively non-motile and have well developed claws from maintaining their position in the nares.

They are commonly known to people with gardens, because they can be small pests. There are only two [[family|families]] of symphylans and only 175 species. 

== Anatomy ==
Symphylans are [[worm|worm-like]] and resemble [[millipede]]s a lot. A symphylan's head has two [[antenna|antennae]] and has no eyes. The trunk of a symphylan is made up of 14 segments. In the last trunk segment is a pair of [[spinneret]]s that do resemble [[cerci]]. The bodies of symphylans are white or pale gray, and are squishy. 

== Life Cycle ==
The males leave a [[spermatophore]] on the ground, and the females use their mouths to scoop them up. The females use mouthparts to remove eggs from their genital opening and then smears the sperm on them from the spermatophore. About 30 [[egg]]s are laid at a time. Once the young hatch, they will have on 12 legs (an adult has 24 legs) and will then gain additional segments and legs during each molt. Certain species are able to live 3 or 4 years!

== Defense ==
Symphylans are fast and flexible, making them be able to run away in time before their predator kills them. 

== Feeding ==
All symphylans are [[herbivorous]], eating off of roots and leaves, making it a greenhouse pest. 

== Geography ==
Symphylans live worldwide in soil and leaf litter in a variety of habitats.

''Chilopoda'' is the main class of centipedes. A centipede is a [[myriapod]] that has usually more than 26 [[leg]]s. The largest species have nearly 64 pairs of legs, shich is contrary to the name. There are 4 [[order]]s and 22 families of centipedes. 

== Appearance ==
A centipede can have anywhere from 26-64 pairs of appendages. A centipede's body is [[worm|worm-like]], covered with a burnished exoskeleton, they generally have a flattened body with two large fangs. And it may look like a centipede has two heads as a trick to confuse predators. Their [[antenna|antennae]] are sometimes barely noticable being around 4-5 cm. 

== Defenses ==
Centipedes are commonly flexible and fast, making it hard to kill or capture one. Most species will also attack with [[venom]], that will sting if you are touched. The venom is injected into the prey through their large fangs while their pointed appendages provide a hold on to their prey or any attacker. Some may use their size as a defense being so minute and barely noticable while the larger species are equipped with deadly toxins. 

== Feeding ==
Centipedes are nocturnal predacious animals, thus meaning that they hunt mainly at night. All centipedes are [[predacious]]. They sometimes even use their venom to kill much larger prey. Their diet commonly includes smaller insects such as orthropterans, smaller centipedes and sometimes even rats and reptiles. 

== Life Cycle ==
The male centipedes drop sperm on the ground and the female eventually picks it up. The [[egg]]s are often laid underground in large clutches. 

== Geography ==
Centipedes mainly live worldwide, but mainly live in temperate locations and tropical and sub-tropical regions. Being most common in temperate and torrid zone generally larger species can be found inhabiting secluded islands and tropical rainforests. 

== Orders ==
Five orders of centipedes exist in the world from prehistoric times to current day. 

===Geophilimorpha===
The order Geophilida is an order of centipedes that are usually straw color to brown and are long and slender, usually made up of 35 segments. 

===Lithobiomorpha===
Lithobiida is an order of centipedes that are usually red-brown with a flat body and usually have around 15 pairs of legs. 

===Scolopendromorpha===
Centipedes in the order Scolopendromorpha are usually brightly coloured with dark stripes or bands. They usually have 21 or 23 pairs of legs. 

===Scutigeromorpha===
Scutigerid centipedes are fairly short that are usually brown with some pale markings. These centipedes have 30 legs that are very long. 

=== Craterostigmorpha ===
Containing only two extant species, ''Craterostigmus crabilli'' and ''Craterostigmus tasmanianus.'' They are restricted to New Zealand and the Tasman area.

== Morphology ==
The House Centipede has a greyish-yellow coloration and has 15 pairs of legs and the maximum size is 20 cm. These legs enable them to reach speeds of up to 1.3 Feet per second along any surface capable of being grappled. They feature a pair of two long, extensive antennae capable of detecting chemical and tactile change in their surroundings, protruding from both their head and posterior. 

== Origins ==
Originally from the Mediterranean region, the species has spread to other parts of the world where it lives in people's homes, thus acquiring the name of "House Centipede".

== Ecology ==

=== Behavior ===
Behaviorally, House Centipedes are nomadic, drawn to the presence of prey and habitability, before searching elsewhere, even if conditions remain unchanged. They do not nest, and they do not parasitize a home's resources, instead devoting their focus to living prey.

When threatened, House Centipedes are non-confrontational unless cornered or physically trapped. Like other centipedes, they are capable of stridulating, producing clicks in order to deter predators and attracts mates. House Centipedes are capable of biting humans when threatened, although this is a rare occurrence, as they tend towards limb-sacrificing and fleeing before defending themselves. 

=== Food Sources ===
It is an insectivore that consumes other arthropods such as insects and arachnids. If anything, an abundance of House Centipedes is an indicator of a more serious arthropod infestation in one's home, although this doesn't leave these centipedes exempt from being intruders themselves, despite the fact that they do not nest or cause any tangible damage to property.

=== Defence mechanism ===
When threatened, House Centipedes are known to involuntarily detach legs much like a Harvestmen Spider in order to escape larger prey, or get themselves out of adhesive traps, sacrificing several limbs in order to continue living.

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Fff.jpg|thumb|233x233px]]Mating takes place in the spring and the females lay between 63-151 eggs.

== Bites ==
Their bites aren’t painful. They’re venom is ineffective on humans. They almost never bite humans. The worst case scenario, bites can cause a rash, nothing more itching and irritation lasts for 1-2 days on average. Large species can deliver a painful bite but not smaller centipedes.

myriapods either instead they are often categorized as a sister group of millipedes.

== Morphology ==
Closely similar in appearance to diplurans, these pale white creatures have a set of multiple legs, their bodies are soft and delicate, their white coloration's reason is due to the fact that many species do not possess any pigmentations whatsoever. Their body lengths range from 0.008 mm to an approximate 2 mm. most adults have 10-16 pairs of legs. They do not possess many important organs such as heart or eyes. They are generally white but can also be brown with minute branched antennae. they are found thriving among leaf litter and soil. 

== Life cycles ==
Pauropods have a simple life cycle, they undergo incomplete metamorphosis although in some cases it can also be said that they do not have any metamorphosis (Similar to all other [[hexapods]])  They start out as a young nymph and only have 3 pairs of legs, as they molt they reach the secondary instar the number of legs they possess increases until they reach adulthood where they possess 9-16 pairs of legs. Otherwise a little or no information is available about their tendencies other than habitat and feeding preferences

== Behavior ==
They have a tendency of staying away from light sheltered underneath leaf litter. These insects are mainly omnivorous with the same saprophytic behavior as Diplurans and zorapterans. They prefer moist tropical or semi-tropical regions, they feed off decaying plant matter alongside smaller invertebrates such as mites and ticks. They do not have a specific hunting method neither they have any other information about their mating behaviors or anything.

'''Millipedes''' are arthropods in the class '''[[Diplopoda]]''', which is characterized by having two pairs of jointed legs on most body segments. Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together as one. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical bodies with more than 20 segments, while [[Pill millipede|pill millipedes]] are shorter and can roll into a ball. Although the name "millipede" derives from the Latin for "thousand feet", though no known species has 1,000, the closest record being 750 legs, belonging to Illacme plenipes. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into sixteen orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures.

== Behavior ==

=== Feeding habits ===
Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating decaying leaves and other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, and a small minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings.

=== Defense mechanisms ===
Most millipedes defend themselves with a variety of defensive chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. 

=== Reproduction ===
Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females. Millipedes are some of the oldest known land animals, first appearing in the Silurian period. Some members of prehistoric groups grew to over 2 m (6 ft 7 in), while the largest modern species reach maximum lengths of 27 to 38 cm (11 to 15 in). The longest extant species is the giant African millipede (''Archispirostreptus gigas'').

== Genre ==
Among myriapods, millipedes have traditionally been considered most closely related to the tiny [[Pauropod|pauropods]], although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related [[Centipede|centipedes]] (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.

== Etymology and names ==
The scientific name "Diplopoda" comes from the Greek words διπλοῦς (diplous), "double" and ποδός (podos), "foot", referring to the appearance of two legs on most segments, as described below. The common name "millipede" is a compound word formed from the Latin roots mille ("thousand") and ped ("foot"). The term "millipede" is widespread in popular and scientific literature, but among North American scientists, the term "milliped" (without the terminal e) is also used.[1] Other vernacular names include "thousand-legger" or simply "diplopod".

== Evolution ==
Millipedes are among the first animals to have colonised land during the Silurian geologic period.[3] Early forms probably ate mosses and primitive vascular plants. There are two major groups of entirely extinct millipedes: the Archipolypoda ("ancient, many-legged ones") which contain the oldest known terrestrial animals, and Arthropleuridea, which contain the largest known land invertebrates. The earliest known land creature, ''Pneumodesmus newmani'', was a 1 cm (0.4 in) long archipolypodan that lived 428 million years ago in the upper Silurian, and has clear evidence of spiracles (breathing holes) attesting to its air-breathing habits.[4][5] During the Upper Carboniferous (340 to 280 million years ago), ''Arthropleura'' became the largest known land-dwelling invertebrate of all time, reaching lengths of at least 2 m (6 ft 7 in).[6] Millipedes also include the earliest evidence of chemical defence, as some Devonian fossils have defensive gland openings called ozopores.[5] Millipedes, centipedes, and other terrestrial arthropods attained very large sizes in comparison to modern species in the oxygen-rich environments of the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, and some could grow larger than one metre. As oxygen levels lowered through time, arthropods became smaller in size. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favored genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.

'''''Anadenobolus monilicornis''''', known as the '''yellow-banded [[millipede]]''' or '''bumble bee millipede''', is a species of millipede in the family Rhinocricidae. It is native to the Caribbean but has been introduced to the southeastern United States.
==Description==
Individuals are dark brown with distinctive yellow bands, and measure 2.5–10 centimetres (1.0–3.9 in) long. The legs and antennae are tinted maroon, It indeed is a beautiful millipede with a vast and abundant population with several generations on annual bases.
==Ecology and behavior==
This species inhabits leaf litter. Birds and captive monkeys have been observed crushing these millipedes and rubbing their secretions on their wings or fur, probably to repel insects.
==Distribution==
With an abundance of habitats thriving with this species, They are found all across central america the most abundant range includes floride and have been seen on Bramhas sea (Nassau Islands) and Mexico alongside being found Puerto rico, San Juan as we extend to the East, This species is thiving in El salvador, In mexico it can be found in several states namely Veracruz, Morelia and near Durango and even Columbia with upto 900 known occurences around central America. These species establish their populations at a rapid pace in wet and moist climatic conditions, they inhabit damp woods as they settle in the rotting wood from which they their food is driven.

'''''Harpaphe haydeniana''''' (the '''yellow-spotted millipede''', '''almond-scented millipede''' or '''cyanide [[millipede]]''') is a species of polydesmidan ("flat-backed") millipede found in the moist forests along the Pacific coast of North America, from Southeast Alaska to California. The dark coloration with contrasting yellow-tipped keels warn of its ability to exude toxic hydrogen cyanide as a defense. Despite the various common names given the species, the coloration pattern, cyanide defense, and associated almond scent occur in other flat-backed millipedes around the world.
==Description==
''H. haydeniana'' reach a length of 4–5 centimeters (1.6–2 in) when mature. The upper surface of the body is black to olive green, and is distinctively marked along the sides with patches of a yellowish colour. ''H. haydeniana'' has approximately twenty body segments, bearing a total of 30 (males) or 31 (females) pairs of legs. The difference between males and females is due to one pair of legs on the seventh segment in males being modified to form gonopods used for sperm transfer. Individuals may live for 2–3 years.
==Distribution==
''H. haydeniana'' occurs from southeast Alaska south to Monterey County, California, as far east as the Sierra Nevada mountains.

They live in the Northern Hemisphere in a variety of habitats. Like most pill millipedes, ''Glomeris marginata'' can roll into a little ball.

== Morpology ==
''Glomeris marginata'' grows up to 20 millimetres (0.8 in) long and 8 mm (0.3 in) wide, and is covered by twelve black dorsal plates with white rims. Each segment except those at the front and back bears two pairs of legs, with around 18 pairs in total. This distinguishes pill millipedes from pill woodlice, both of which are called "pillbugs" woodlice have 7 pairs of walking legs, one per body segment, while millipedes have more pairs, and with two pairs to each apparent body segment. When rolled into a ball, ''G. marginata'' can be distinguished from a rolled–up pill woodlouse by the asymmetrical ball it rolls into; pill woodlice roll into much more perfect spheres. The cuticle is also darker and shinier, and the antennae are shorter. The head and tail of a woodlouse have a greater number of small plates, while the head of ''Glomeris'' is protected by a single large shield, and it lacks the uropods of woodlice at the read end. Although usually black, red, yellow and brown individuals do occasionally occur.

== Ecology ==
''Glomeris marginata'' lives in leaf litter as well as in grass and under stones, with a preference for calcareous soils. In domestic gardens, they are most frequent along hedgerows and at the bases of old walls, where the mortar has started to crumble, leaching lime into the soil. It is less prone to desiccation than other millipedes and can be found in the open, even in sunny weather, although they are more active at night and prefer more humid areas. ''G. marginata'' feeds on old, rotting leaves, despite the higher nutrient content of freshly–fallen leaves, and ''G. marginata'' can be responsible for recycling a significant proportion of the nutrients in the leaf litter.

== Behavior ==
Predators of ''Glomeris marginata'' are reported to include the starling, the common toad, the woodlouse spider, and hedgehogs. As well as rolling up into a ball for protection, ''G. marginata'' produces noxious chemicals to ward off potential predators, as many millipedes do. One to eight drops of a viscid fluid are secreted, containing the quinazolinone alkaloids glomerin and homoglomerin, dissolved in a watery protein matrix. These chemicals act as antifeedants and toxins to spiders, insects and vertebrates, and the fluid is sticky enough to entrap the legs of ants. Having completely discharged these chemical defences, it can take up to four months for the millipede to replenish their supplies.

== Life cycle ==

=== Reproduction ===
Breeding takes place cyclically in spring and summer. Male ''G. marginata'' are capable of producing a pheromone which attracts females, although this is only believed to be effective over short distances. They then transfer sperm to the female using their gonopods, specially modified legs. After fertilisation, the females lay 70–80 eggs, each about 1 mm long, and each wrapped singly in a capsule of digested earth. 

=== Nymphal Stage ===
The eggs hatch after a period of about two months, with the duration depending on factors including temperature. Development lasts for up to three years, and involves nine moults, following which moults occur periodically as adults. Females are fertile for several years, and can produce six broods over their lifetime, which can be up to eleven years

== Geographical range ==
''Glomeris marginata'' is found throughout central and north-western Europe, from Poland and Scandinavia to Spain and Italy. In the British Isles, it is found in all areas south of the Central Belt of Scotland. ''Glomeris marginata'' lives in leaf litter as well as in grass and under stones, with a preference for calcareous soils. In domestic gardens, they are most frequent along hedgerows and at the bases of old walls, where the mortar has started to crumble, leaching lime into the soil. It is less prone to desiccation than other millipedes and can be found in the open, even in sunny weather, although they are more active at night and prefer more humid and damp atmospheres.

Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together as one. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical bodies with more than 20 segments, while [[pill millipede]]s are shorter and can roll into a ball. Although the name "millipede" derives from the Latin for "thousand feet", though no known species has 1,000, the closest record being 750 legs, belonging to Illacme plenipes. There are approximately 12,000 named species classified into sixteen orders and around 140 families, making Diplopoda the largest class of myriapods, an arthropod group which also includes centipedes and other multi-legged creatures.

Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating decaying leaves and other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, and a small minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves with a variety of defensive chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.

Millipedes are some of the oldest known land animals, first appearing in the Silurian period. Some members of prehistoric groups grew to over 2 m (6 ft 7 in), while the largest modern species reach maximum lengths of 27 to 38 cm (11 to 15 in). The longest extant species is the giant African millipede (''[[Archispirostreptus gigas]]'').

Among myriapods, millipedes have traditionally been considered most closely related to the tiny [[pauropod]]s, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related [[centipede]]s (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.
==Etymology and names==
The scientific name "Diplopoda" comes from the Greek words διπλοῦς (diplous), "double" and ποδός (podos), "foot", referring to the appearance of two legs on most segments, as described below. The common name "millipede" is a compound word formed from the Latin roots mille ("thousand") and ped ("foot"). The term "millipede" is widespread in popular and scientific literature, but among North American scientists, the term "milliped" (without the terminal e) is also used.[1] Other vernacular names include "thousand-legger" or simply "diplopod".
==Evolution==
Millipedes are among the first animals to have colonised land during the Silurian geologic period.[3] Early forms probably ate mosses and primitive vascular plants. There are two major groups of entirely extinct millipedes: the Archipolypoda ("ancient, many-legged ones") which contain the oldest known terrestrial animals, and Arthropleuridea, which contain the largest known land invertebrates. The earliest known land creature, ''Pneumodesmus newmani'', was a 1 cm (0.4 in) long archipolypodan that lived 428 million years ago in the upper Silurian, and has clear evidence of spiracles (breathing holes) attesting to its air-breathing habits.[4][5] During the Upper Carboniferous (340 to 280 million years ago), ''Arthropleura'' became the largest known land-dwelling invertebrate of all time, reaching lengths of at least 2 m (6 ft 7 in).[6] Millipedes also include the earliest evidence of chemical defence, as some Devonian fossils have defensive gland openings called ozopores.[5] Millipedes, centipedes, and other terrestrial arthropods attained very large sizes in comparison to modern species in the oxygen-rich environments of the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, and some could grow larger than one metre. As oxygen levels lowered through time, arthropods became smaller in size.[7]

Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favored genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.

== Appearance ==
Ammotrechids are slender and can be colored in many shades of brown. The [[tarsus|tarsi]] in the front pair of [[leg]]s have no claws, and the front part of the head is rounded. 

== Life ==
The female will lay her [[egg]]s in several batches, probably in a burrow. 
----
Many species of Ammotrechids are nocturnal. The nocturnal species dig into the soil, but some species hide in [[termite]] colonies. 

== Defense ==
Ammotrechids will usually bite predators or prey with their large [[chelicerae]]. 

== Feeding habits ==
Ammotrechids are [[predacious]] and they eat [[insect]]s and a few small lizards. 

== Geography ==
Ammotrechids live in warm locations of Central America,and South America, and North America. Usually in dry,desert or semiarid areas.

''Chinchippus peruvianus'' is a species of [[sun-spider]]  belonging to the monotypic (prior to  

{{More_detailed_infobox|title1=Chinchippus peruvianus|image1=Chinchippus peruvianus.jpg|caption1=Adult female specimen|common_name=—|order=[[Solifugae]]|genus=Chinchippus|family=[[Ammotrechidae]]|diet=Predacious/scavenger 
Diet includes Amphipods, springtails, sea bird carcasses and maritime prey|activity=Unknown|distribution=Guano Island, Ica region in central Peru|habitat=Coastal desert|other_common_names=—}}

2009) [[genus]]: ''[[Chinchippus]]''. This species is only found in the Ica Region of Central Peru. It wasn't discovered until 1920 and was found American Biologist Ralp Vary Chamberlain. C. Peruvians is known only from a single female specimen (shown in the adjoining image). 

== Biology ==

=== Morphology ===
While not much is known about the species Chinchippus peruvianus. They are known to have a lighter coloration, larger size and different chelicerae in comparison with C. Viajaensis (The only other known Solifuge in genus Chinchippus described in 2009) as stated [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250062832_Natural_history_of_coastal_Peruvian_solifuges_with_a_redescription_of_Chinchippus_peruvianus_and_an_additional_new_species_Arachnida_Solifugae_Ammotrechidae here].

== Behaviour ==

=== Feeding Habits ===
It can be speculated that C. Peruvianus along with the other species in genus Chinchippus are predacious but may also exhibit scavenger hunting, feeding off carcasses and maritime fauna in respect to their coastal-Arid Habitat.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Size-distribution-of-Chinchippus-peruvianus-n-5-101-individuals-at-Cangrejal-Paracas_fig4_250062832&lt;/ref&gt; they’re prey could include amphipods &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250062832_Natural_history_of_coastal_Peruvian_solifuges_with_a_redescription_of_Chinchippus_peruvianus_and_an_additional_new_species_Arachnida_Solifugae_Ammotrechidae&lt;/ref&gt;and seabird carcasses.

=== Other behaviours ===
It could also be presumed that c. Peruvianus tends to stay in burrows&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/acatenazzi/chinchippus&lt;/ref&gt; , although it is worth mentioning that no other information is currently available on this article in regards to the specie’s behaviour.

'''Solifugae''' is the order of [[sun-spider]]s. A '''sun-spider''' also known as a '''wind scorpion''' is an [[arachnid]] that resembles a [[scorpion]] and a [[spider]] in spite of neither being spiders or scorpions. There are 12 families and 1,000 species in the sun-spider's order, Solifugae. They are well-known for being desert-dwellers. They are fairly agile (in regards to their body length) reaching a maximum speed of 16km/hr. They are famous among insects handlers, are adorable and make good low-maintenance pets.

== Morphology ==

=== Anatomy ===
In terms of anatomical sense, Sun-spiders have flexible [[abdomen]]s with a fairly small [[cephalothorax]] and a head with small eyes. They use their huge, swollen[[chelicerae]] to kill and eat prey. Sun-spiders also have sensitive body hairs and organs in their last pair of walking legs. They have 4 pairs of legs with two being antenniform appendages and Long, finely segmented pedipalps for foraging some have scissors-like chelicerae for ensnaring their prey. Various species have been known to differ drastically.

==== Size ====
In terms of overall body length the largest of Sun spiders reach 6 inches in length (including the legspan).

== Behaviour ==
wind scorpions love shady areas and are known to rush towards humans before stopping by their shadows, they sometimes follow people to stay in their shadows. They are very cute and make good pets.

=== Defence mechanism ===
Sun spiders may look intimidating yet their lack of venom could perhaps make them be considered as a weak creature, however Sun spiders have quite a few tricks up their sleeves, firstly they have extreme flexibility allowing them to forage burrows and navigate tunnels avoiding any conflicts altogether, their flexibility also allows them to consume prey fairly larger than their bodies through their bag-like stomachs. They also have good agility allowing them to sprint away from any potentially dangerous predators. Lastly they are even known to possess stridulation mainly performed through their oversized chelicerae i.e a loud “ksssk ksssk ksssk” chatter when disturbed.

== Feeding ==
All sun-spider are [[predacious]]. They are opportunistic, free-roaming hunters and have quite a few structural adaptations for hunting.

=== Structural Adaptations ===
Usings their fine sensory hairs, and well-segmented pedipalps for hunting prey, they have chelicerae for tearing apart their prey, while not as large as threat to humans due to their inability to produce toxins, they utilise the  large and powerful jaws for crushing their prey, the prey is then injected with digestive juices, liquified and dead, the wind scorpions proceed to drink the liquified prey. 

== [[Insect habitat|Habitat]] ==
Most sun-spiders like a habitat that is dry and hot, though while most species favor arid, desolated regions. Sometimes even inhabit the the African savanna or arid scrublands (though extremely rare) 

== Occurence ==
Most sun-spiders live in Asia, Africa, and some parts of North America.

'''Ammotrechidae''' is a family of solifuges distributed in the Americas and the Caribbean Islands. It includes 22 described genera and at least 83 species. 

== Notable Features ==
Members of this family can be distinguished from members of other families by the absence of claws on tarsi of leg I, tarsal segmentation 1-2-2-(2-4), pedipalps with pairs of lateroventral spines, and by males having an immovable flagellum on the mesal face of each chelicerum. The propeltidium of the Ammotrechidae is recurved.

== Behavior ==
The common names used for Ammotrechidae are '''curve-faced solifugids''' and '''sand runners'''. They live in arid regions, such as dune and rocky habitats. They are carnivores which feed mainly on other invertebrates. Ammotrechidae have relatively high metabolic rates, which allow them to be voracious predators. They feed by masticating their prey and sucking out the liquids. They are preyed upon by other vertebrates. Species of Ammotrechidae are found to be cannibalistic. Males and females dig shallow burrows for protection and nesting.

== Distribution ==
The species in North America are found in the South to Southwest and are rarely longer than 2 inches. Though they can be pests, they are considered beneficial because they feed on scorpions, spiders, and termites.

== Taxonomy ==
This family is subdivided in 5 subfamilies and 22 genera.

''Gluvia dorsalis'' , also known as the '''Iberian solifuge or European Solifugid''' is the only [[sun-spider]] that is inhabitant to Portugal and Spain,. It belongs to the monotypic genus [[Gluvia]]. 

== Morphology ==
Gluvia dorsalis reaches about 2.2 inches on average, they possess a copper-coloured prosoma, Opisthosoma is glossy, burnished-black, they possess razor-sharp chelicerae. The pedipalps are greatly enlarged and darken distally. Small bristles sit over their bodies, essentialls for receiving stimuli. The pedipalps of Gluvia dorsalis are longer than the first two pairs of legs. 

== Ecology ==

=== Life history ===
Gluvia dorsalis is a biennial species with reproduction occurring during June. The eggs are laid 11 days after fertilisation Gluvia dorsalis is ovoviviparous the females perish shortly after oviposition. About 84 eggs on average are laid in a burrow. Larvae are born after 56 days and do not feed for another 17 days, followed by the occurrence of their first molt. Infants reach sexual maturity 7-8 months on average. The infants burrow themselves during molting so, as to let their new exoskeleton harden. The prime activities occur from May till November which is followed by a hibernation. During hibernation the species remains inside it’s burrow.

=== Hunting ===
[[File:Gluvia dorsalis(4).jpeg|thumb|Close up of the chelicerae]]
Gluvia dorsalis is a strictly nocturnal species. Known for their agility, the species scuttles around at an erratic pace stopping from time to time. The prey is snatched and crushed with the help of their strong chelicerae.[[File:Gluvia_dorsalis.jpg|thumb]]

==== Feeding ====
Gluvia dorsalis is strictly predacious with ants forming a major part of it’s diet, Gluvia dorsalis are also known to feed off spiders, isopods and scale insects.

== Geographical distribution ==

=== Range ===
As mentioned earlier, Gluvia dorsalis is the only known solifuge native to the Iberian peninsular with it’s range extending from Spain to Portugal.

=== Habitat ===
Typically found in open, low-vegetation grasslands and semi-Arid areas with occasional, summer rain showers, Gluvia dorsalis can be found in forests although it is much rarer and seldom-seen out of it’s natural habitat. They do not prefer areas with high-humidity and better correlate with higher temperatures.

==Geographical range==
''Androctonus'' is widespread in North and West Africa, the Middle East and eastwards to the Hindukush region. Countries where ''Androctonus'' species live include: Armenia, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Togo, Palestine, Israel, India, Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bahrain and Pakistan.
==Etymology==
A rough English translation of the name ''Androctonus'' is "man-killer", from the Greek andras (άνδρας), meaning "man" and kteinein (κτείνειν), meaning "to kill". ''Crassicauda'' means fat-tailed, from the Latin crassus meaning "thick" or "fat" and cauda, meaning "tail". ''Androctonus crassicauda'' is widespread throughout the Middle East and its name means "fat-tailed man-killer". Similarly, the Latin word for South is australis, from which ''Androctonus australis'', "southern man-killer", derives.

This species is usually yellow with a dark top[3] and has lobster-like pincers. It gets its common names from the brown hairs that cover its body. These hairs help it to detect vibration in the soil.[3] A similar species is ''[[Hadrurus spadix]]''.

''Hadrurus arizonensis'' is distributed throughout the Sonora and Mojave deserts. In Mexico, the species' range flanks the Gulf of California in Sonora and Baja California Norte. In the United States, it is found in the western two thirds of Arizona, the Colorado Desert and Mojave Desert regions of southern California, southern Nevada, and extreme southwestern Utah. Arizona Desert hairy scorpions are a warm-desert species, specially adapted to hot and dry conditions. They are usually found in and around washes or low-elevation valleys where they dig elaborate burrows (up to 2.5 m or 8 ft 2 in) and emerge at night to forage for prey and mates. Other species commonly encountered living sympatrically with this species are: ''Smeringurus mesaensis'', ''Hoffmannius confusus'', and ''[[Hoffmannius spinigerus]]''.
==Diet and behavior==
It is a burrowing scorpion, but is commonly found under rocks containing moisture. Its diet consists of large [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, and small vertebrates.[2] This is an aggressive and active scorpion, which, as with all scorpions, is nocturnal. Like all scorpions, the giant desert hairy scorpion gives birth to live young, which remain on the mother's back for a week or more before leaving.

==Hardiness==
Unlike most other animals that live in deserts, ''Androctonus'' does not dig burrows to protect itself from a sandstorm. Instead, it can withstand sandstorms powerful enough to strip paint off steel, without any apparent damage. The resistance of ''Androctonus'' to sandstorms is suspected to be due to the discovery of its odd exoskeleton surface. Its armor is covered with dome-shaped granules that are 10 µm (0.0004 in) high and 25–80 µm (0.0010–0.0031 in) across. When its odd surface is translated into other materials it protects them to a certain degree as well, which has led to the possibility of the applicability of imitation surfaces in such objects as aeroplanes and helicopters.
==Etymology==
The name ''Androctonus australis'' is derived from the Greek word ''Androctonus'' (roughly translated as "man-killer") and the Latin word australis (translated as "south") which together translate as "southern man-killer".

Bryson Jr., after whom the species is named. At the date of its discovery it became the tenth species of mountain scorpion known to occur in Arizona, and the second in the vorhiesi group to inhabit the specific mountain range.
==Description and near relatives==
The female of the species has a body measurement of about 27.5 millimetres (1.08 in).[2] As to its behavior, like other scorpions the female will carry its offspring on its back – up to 24 at one time. It is related to other creatures in the same genus and/or family such as the ''[[Vaejovis janssi]]'', ''[[Hoffmannius spinigerus]]'' and ''H. coahuilae''.
==Sympatric range==
Scorpions of the same evolutionary family inhabit the same region of the South West, particularly the southern regions of Arizona, some areas of Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico – the Sonoran region being their typical habitat. This species in particular was discovered in the Santa Catalina Mountains of Arizona near Tucson. Another scorpion of the same genus, ''Vaejovis deboerae'', inhabits this mountain range creating the peculiar situation where two members of the vorhiesi species have been found inhabiting the same area, and this due to the isolation each mountain, even within the same range, provides.

The Armadilliudium vulgare, or the Pillbug is a land crustacean insect. It comes from the family [[Armadillidiidae]] and is the most researched [[Isopoda]]

==Appearance==
Pillbugs are a grayish colour like most of its family. They roll into a ball if disturbed and can survive a metre tall drop in the air. When rolled, their shell is tightly sealed. Many, or perhaps, most, have a slight yellow pattern striking their back. They measure 1-2 millimetres in length at the rolled up position, but have a normal 5 millimetre measure.

==Habitat==
These are found commonly in Europe and are widespread, but are found also in western North America. They are usually found walking mindlessly outside of flower or vegetable gardens at local suburban homes. You may also spot them climbing walls or tree bark with dry moss. As they grow through age, their main food source is dead leaf from a vegetable or tree. When raining, they hide in their roll-up form.

Pill Bugs can survive in very dry climates, the best of the family. They tend to roll or move away from a source of water. They cannot survive temperatures above 35°C and hide in shadow with this temperature. Most of their day is spent eating in the soil, but tend to walk into the sidewalk occasionally.
