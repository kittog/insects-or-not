''Chilopoda'' is the main class of centipedes. A centipede is a [[myriapod]] that has usually more than 26 [[leg]]s. The largest species have nearly 64 pairs of legs, shich is contrary to the name. There are 4 [[order]]s and 22 families of centipedes. 

== Appearance ==
A centipede can have anywhere from 26-64 pairs of appendages. A centipede's body is [[worm|worm-like]], covered with a burnished exoskeleton, they generally have a flattened body with two large fangs. And it may look like a centipede has two heads as a trick to confuse predators. Their [[antenna|antennae]] are sometimes barely noticable being around 4-5 cm. 

== Defenses ==
Centipedes are commonly flexible and fast, making it hard to kill or capture one. Most species will also attack with [[venom]], that will sting if you are touched. The venom is injected into the prey through their large fangs while their pointed appendages provide a hold on to their prey or any attacker. Some may use their size as a defense being so minute and barely noticable while the larger species are equipped with deadly toxins. 

== Feeding ==
Centipedes are nocturnal predacious animals, thus meaning that they hunt mainly at night. All centipedes are [[predacious]]. They sometimes even use their venom to kill much larger prey. Their diet commonly includes smaller insects such as orthropterans, smaller centipedes and sometimes even rats and reptiles. 

== Life Cycle ==
The male centipedes drop sperm on the ground and the female eventually picks it up. The [[egg]]s are often laid underground in large clutches. 

== Geography ==
Centipedes mainly live worldwide, but mainly live in temperate locations and tropical and sub-tropical regions. Being most common in temperate and torrid zone generally larger species can be found inhabiting secluded islands and tropical rainforests. 

== Orders ==
Five orders of centipedes exist in the world from prehistoric times to current day. 

===Geophilimorpha===
The order Geophilida is an order of centipedes that are usually straw color to brown and are long and slender, usually made up of 35 segments. 

===Lithobiomorpha===
Lithobiida is an order of centipedes that are usually red-brown with a flat body and usually have around 15 pairs of legs. 

===Scolopendromorpha===
Centipedes in the order Scolopendromorpha are usually brightly coloured with dark stripes or bands. They usually have 21 or 23 pairs of legs. 

===Scutigeromorpha===
Scutigerid centipedes are fairly short that are usually brown with some pale markings. These centipedes have 30 legs that are very long. 

=== Craterostigmorpha ===
Containing only two extant species, ''Craterostigmus crabilli'' and ''Craterostigmus tasmanianus.'' They are restricted to New Zealand and the Tasman area.
