'''''Phidippus clarus''''' is a species of jumping [[spider]] (family Salticidae) found in old fields throughout eastern North America. It often waits 

upside down near the top of a plant, which may be useful for detecting prey, and then quickly jumps down before the prey can escape. The spider is one of 60 species in the genus ''[[Phidippus]]'',:vii and one of about 5,000 in the [[Salticidae]], a family that accounts for about 10% of all spider species. Phidippus ''clarus'' is a predator, mostly taking insects, other spiders, and other terrestrial arthropods.

== Behavior ==
Like other jumping spiders, it has vision more acute than a cat and ten times more acute than a dragonfly. The eyes are used to locate prey and rivals, and find and court mates. All spiders have sensors for smell, taste, touch and vibration protruding through their cuticle ("skin"). Jumping spiders can leap up to 50 times their own length by powerfully extending the third or fourth pairs of legs, with the longer forelimbs extended to grasp the prey. ''P. clarus'', a relatively large salticid, takes prey up to the size of an adult earwig. In an experiment, ''P. clarus''was offered as many fruit flies as it could eat, and in four-hour sessions individuals took 17 flies on average – while one took 41.

=== Rivalry Habits ===
When ''P. clarus'' males compete for females, the winners are those that produce the most vibrations on the surface and those that are largest. Contests between females involve less displaying, and physical fights between females are more likely to end in injury or death. The most successful males choose the largest females, as these produce the most eggs and most quickly. If a female that has mated already then finds a larger male, she will often mate again with the larger male. The average clutch is 135 eggs. Unlike most of the genus ''Phidippus'', ''P. clarus'' females die after one brood has left the nest. ''P. clarus'' is parasitized by the Californian wasp ''[[Aporinellus completes]]'' and by mermithid nematodes. In an experiment in 2006, ''P. clarus'' showed promise for controlling the fourlined plant bug, ''[[Poecilocapsus lineatus]]'', which severely damages the commercially grown sweet basil.
==Morphology==
Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace and that of female ''Phidippus clarus'' average 4.05 millimetres (0.159 in) wide, while the carapaces of males average 3.20 millimetres (0.126 in). The differences among males and females are clearly noticable with the males being coated densely with black sensory hairs with an irregular red colored abdomen and a single black line passing through the red abdomen. They have a certain variety when it comes to the males the patterns on the abdomen can be different shades of Yellow, orange and scarlet with the same size and density of the single line, females on the other hand have their bodies coated with several shades of brown with irregular patterns on the thorax and the abdomen, Females also have an Eastern form with that one having a similar appearance to the males.
==Feeding==
Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, other spiders, and other non-aquatic arthropods. The most common procedure is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs to jump on the victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch. After capturing the prey, ''P. clarus'' settles in one spot and does not move again until it has discarded the undigestible hard remains of the prey. If ''P. clarus'' has gone without food for a few days, it eats slowly. ''P. clarus'', which is large by the standards of salticids, takes prey up to the size of an adult earwig. In an experiment, the jumping spider was offered as many fruit flies as it could eat, and in 4-hour sessions specimens took 17 flies on average—while one took. When the courtship display of wolf spider ''[[Schizocosa ocreata]]'' combines visual signals with vibrations, ''P. clarus'' responds to its wolf spider prey more quickly than when the wolf spider presents only one of the types of signal.
==Reproduction==
''Phidippus clarus'' becomes adult in early summer, and females about to lay eggs can weigh 400 milligrams (0.014 oz). Early in the breeding season, in early to mid-July, there are more males than females. The females all become sexually mature at the same time. At this point of the breeding season males die off, so that the number of males becomes equal to or slightly smaller than the number of females. By August, most females live in their nests overnight for increasing periods, as this is where they will lay eggs. The nests are located in rolled up leaves and are made of thick silk, which is expensive to build. The egg sacs are conspicuous, as they are made of such thick silk. Tests show that females use visual landmarks to return to their nests. A male only remains at the same nest when paired with a female. like other spiders and many other arthropods, ''P. clarus'' can vibrate surfaces to interact with others of its species, sometimes in conjunction with other communications such as movements, to intimidate rivals 

== Metamorphosis ==
The egg membrane is shed in 24–26 days, but the hatchlings (the first instar) continue to mature in the cocoon. The first molt occurs 24–28 days after the membrane is shed, and two to three days later the spiderlings leave their protective cover and become active, independent individuals. They do not hunt immediately, even if prey is available, but spend several hours engaged in apparently random activity before seeking cover, where they remain between two hours and two days. About 10% of spiderlings build retreats during this period, while the rest do so only after they have fed. The mothers usually die a few days after the spiderlings leave the nest.
