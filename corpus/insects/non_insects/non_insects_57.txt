There are only 3 families and 130 species of whip-spiders. The order of whip-spiders is [[Amblypygi]]. 

== Appearance ==
These rare and beautiful  arachnids have flattened bodies and a broad [[cephalothorax]]. The [[pedipalp]]s can be long, slender, or short, and possibly sharp depending on the species. The [[tarsus|tarsi]] are sharp. The pedipalps hold prey, while the arachnid's [[chelicerae]] tear apart the prey. The pair of front limbs are spectacularly modified for holding and stabbing prey simultaneously. They are not venomous. A beautiful arachnid rare to see. 

== Life cycle ==
Males drop a [[spermatophore]] on the ground, where they are picked up by a female's [[genitalia]]. Females carry around their [[egg]]s and the young hatch in a brood sack. The young are pale white to light brown or beige in colour and turn darker with each molt.

== Behaviour ==

=== Mobility and Hunting ===
they use 6 legs for walking, the frontal pair is larger that the legs, thicker and is adorned with sharp spikes, the front legs are slightly hooked at the ends and are usually held straight to each other folded in a V shape. When hunting their frontal legs jab at their prey and grab them whilst the prey is pierced by their fangs. They move in a sidewalk (crab-like).

== Feeding habits ==
All whip-spiders are [[predacious]]. They feed on centipedes, spiders and other cave dwelling insects such as beetles.

== [[Insect habitat|Habitat]] ==
Whip-spiders favor tropical and sub-tropical areas. They are also known to be ground dwellers and may also inhabit caves.
