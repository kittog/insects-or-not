Adults measure about 35–45 millimetres (1.4–1.8 in) long. It is a fossorial scorpion with relatively large, strong claws (pedipalps) and a short, thin tail.
==Distribution==
The native range of ''E. flavicaudis'' extends through Northwest Africa and Southern Europe, but it has also been introduced into the United Kingdom and Uruguay. It is the northernmost scorpion in the world and the only one in the UK. The main colony in Britain is in Sheerness Dockyard, the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.
==Habitat==
Warm temperate climate. The species can be found in built up areas. In the UK, the scorpion occupies cracks and holes in walls where the mortar pointing has crumbled away.
