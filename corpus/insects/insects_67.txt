Pteromalid
[[File:Female Catolaccus grandis wasp.jpg|thumb|164px|''[[Catolaccus grandis]]'']]'''Pteromalids''' are [[wasp]]s belonging to the [[Pteromalidae]] [[family]] and the [[Hymenoptera]] [[order]]. They belong to a large family of about 4000 species. All Pteromalids are in fact [[parasatic]], feeding off the [[larvae]] of other [[insect]]s. Most Pteromalids are metallic in color, and some have long [[ovipositor]]s. Some species will lay eggs in [[gall]]s, where their larvae can feed on what is inside. These wasps live worldwide, wherever hosts are found.
