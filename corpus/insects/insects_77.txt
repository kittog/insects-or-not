Xylophagomorpha
The Brachyceran infraorder '''Xylophagomorpha''' is a small group that consists solely of the family '''[[Xylophagidae]]''', which presently contains subfamilies that were sometimes considered to be two small related families ('''[[Coenomyiidae]]''' and '''[[Rachiceridae]]'''). Other obsolete names for members of this family include '''[[Exeretonevridae]]''' and '''[[Heterostomidae]]'''. The family is known by the English name '''[[Flies|awl-flies]]'''. The larvae are often predatory, consuming other insect larvae living in rotting wood.
