Lonomia obliqua, the giant silkworm moth, is a species of saturniid moth from South 

America. It is famous for its larval form, rather than the

adult moth, primarily because of the caterpillar's defense mechanism, urticating bristles that inject a potentially deadly venom

== Morphology ==
These caterpillars are about 4.5 to 5.5 centimeters (about 2 in) long, with background colors ranging from green to brown. Well camouflaged, they have rows of tubercles crowned with whorls of easily detachable spines of different sizes.

== Behavior ==

=== Defense mechanism ===

Caterpillars of many species can cause irritation by their hollow body hairs that envenom or detach easily, or can be poisonous if ingested; however, prior to investigations into ''Lonomia'' caterpillars, it was not known that caterpillars could produce toxins which in sufficient quantities could kill a human being. ''Lonomia obliqua'' is found in the south of Brazil in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Paraná. The species appears to be spreading to the southeast of Brazil, and recent accidents with the species were reported in the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais. ''Lonomia obliqua'' is also found in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina.

== Toxicology ==
It was discovered that the toxin in the caterpillar's skin held potent anti-clotting agents. This anti-clotting agent would attach to another protein of the body's cells and cause them to leak as blood is unable to clot. This internal bleeding would fill the surrounding tissue with "bruised blood". This internal bleeding spreads through the internal organs and eventually leads to compression and brain death.

== Symptoms ==
The early symptoms include rashes, burning pain, itching followed by nausea and mild fever that increases over time. More severe symptoms include respiratory problems, difficulties with breathing, delayed clotting of blood, tissue death, organ failure which ultimately results in death of the victim worst of all, there is no known cure nor there is any antidote till this date. '''The only known treatment to a Lonomia obliqua sting is antifibrinolytics'''.
