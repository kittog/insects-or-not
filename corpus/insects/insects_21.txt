exotic shimmering indigo color, their wings are tinted with a wide array of mesmerizing colors, unfortunately they are regarded as endangered and many thought they are now extinct however it is estimated there are more than 800 species alive however they are only seen on highly rare occasions due to their secretive habitats deep into the woodlands and lush-green forests, they are hardly ever seen in urban areas mainly due to habitat loss although fairly common.

== Morphology ==
The glittering mantle butterfly has an overwhelmingly beautiful appearance with mesmerizing shades of light green, olive green, indigo, and a wide array of similar colorations with their bodies being Prussian blue with bright green large compound eyes with a lustrous metallic shades occurring between blue to green and Green bordered edges and the center of their wings meeting at the [[thorax]] speckled with metallic green, they also have a pair of large [[Antenna|antennae]] which extend straight outwards being one of the key features to differentiate between lepidopterans (Butterflies and moths) their wingspan has an approximate length which is currently undetermined, a little or no information is available regarding their life cycles neither their is a physical description for the juvenile.

== Behavior ==
The adults spend most of their time perching on the canopy of vast rainforests and woodlands and are most likely to be discovered basking at low levelled foliage perching with their wings wide open over patches of weeds and moss as the green pigment on their wings conceals them while perching on batches of weeds and grass they prefer basking under sunshine near rivers and lakes while perching onto the pebbles near shallow streams of water. They are exceedingly elusive and seen only when they descend to immobile the water streams near freshwater and tropical canopy, they can also be seen sitting on edges of barks of trees creating a false notion to predators that they are nothing but moss crawling over the tree trunk and may occasionally get many by surprise by flying and making a quick escape upon realizing that  it's life under threat. A little of no information is available regarding their life  cycle or their habitual behaviors such as food for example.
