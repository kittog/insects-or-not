Adults can be found from April to August. They are polyphagous, mainly sucking vegetable juices of grasses, but also of other plants (''Arrhenatherum elatius'', ''Dactylis glomerata'', ''Urtica dioica'', ''Filipendula ulmaria'', ''Aegopodium podagraria'', etc.), 

=== Flight ===
They can easily fly and are also equipped with very effective saltatory back legs, allowing jumps of up to 70 centimeters. They can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.

== Metamorphosis ==
When they mate ''Cercopis'' male and female stay side by side with an angle of less than 45Â°. The female lays eggs at the end of summer in plants and trees that overwinter. Larvae live underground on the roots of various plants, inside a typical foam nest, that protects them from dehydration and against enemies. The nymph sucks vegetable juices out of the roots of the host plants. The nymph comes up in spring.

* ''Arrhenatherum elatius'' (False-Oat Grass)
* ''Dactylis glomerata'' (Cat-grass)
* ''Urtica dioica'' (Stinging Nettles)
