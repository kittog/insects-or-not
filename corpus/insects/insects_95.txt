Nemopteridae is the order of spoonwings, there are less than 200 species of Nemopteridae they belong to the order [[Neuroptera]], they are sometimes known as thread tailed antlions and can be easily confused with swallowtail butterflies in flight. These insects have a large pair of vibrantly colored wings painted with pigmented scales and their hindwings morphed into a long-thread like structure that are normally larger in their size compared to the forewings. They can easily mistaken for a swallowtail butterfly in their flight motion due to their physical appearencce. They are predatory and feed on small-soft bodied insects. Spoonwings in the case of males posses a bulla located at the margin of the wings which used to release pheromones to attract mates They have a rather weak-fluttering flight and are often seen circling and moving in a chronological wave-like pattern. They can either be nocturnal or diurnal. They have two sub-families and in this article we're mentioning Nemopteridae which compromises of day-flying insects that can be found in a diverse range of habitats.

there can be a little confusion when we talk about habitat of these insects as they prefer a wide range of habitats the most common habitat included sunny large patches of meadows thriving with enough food to last for generations but some spoonwings prefer shrublands and deserts as a suitable habitat some spoonwings have even adapted themselves to their survival in urbanization. Although they are becoming quite rare which is due to loss of habitat in nature. They have a great liking for semi-arid or arid climatic conditions especially semi-arid regions scattered with shrubs and bushes (shrubland)
