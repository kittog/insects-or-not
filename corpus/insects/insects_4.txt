In Japanese, rhinoceros beetles are called ''kabutomushi'' (かぶとむし, also written 甲虫 or かぶと虫). ''Mushi'' is Japanese for insect, and ''kabuto'' is Japanese for helmet, literally referring to the samurai helmet. The beetle's Korean name meaning 'Jangsupungdeng-i(장수풍뎅이, "General beetle") is similar in nature but it sounds completely different. In Chinese the beetle is called '獨角仙' (which translates to 'single-horned immortal') or '雙叉犀金龜'.

Horns can range in size and shape These are used to defeat other beetles or to plow through tough soil or stone. Females do not obtain horns. The males can reach lengths of 40-80 mm (excluding the horns) The Tibia and tarsus are coated densely with sharp spikes that end with a pair of sickle-end claws on each limb in females, the apex of the abdomen is aligned with rows of spikes. the larva ave pale white bodies with  bodies composed of  several ring-like segments with three pairs of brown legs and a dark-brown bulbous head.
