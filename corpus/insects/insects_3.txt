== Defination ==
Cetoniinae compromises of flower chafers this order has 4000 described species but more than an additional half is currently undiscovered, Flower chafers help in pollination of fruits and flowers and fertilize them (Although some species feed on them) , most of them are diurnal and have a wide array of colors and a lustrous exoskeleton, their Habitual action has one thing in particular kept in great quantities and yes, it is pollination. Some species also feed on fruit and are regarded as a mild threat to agricultural economical production.

== Appearance ==
While visiting you local garden many people must've seen a glare of light being reflected by something perching upon a flower, that is not what it seems, instead it is a flower chafer, this is one of their most remarkably known feature, a lustrous and shiny [[exoskeleton]] that will reflect light and their colors varying according to the propagation of light and the pattern of the light falling onto it's [[exoskeleton]]. Flower chafer are remarkably known for helping in pollination and show all the features that are shown by any ordinary specimen belonging to the family [[polyphaga]], and that is the absence of the '''notopleural''' suture (can be observed underneath the pronotal shield) also another important thing is that the hind [[coxa]] (base of the leg), is conjoint and does not intact the first and second abdominal and ventral cavities (known as sternites) Flowers chafers vary in colors ranging from green to golden to vermillion and violet.

== Food ==

Cetoniinae certainly does not lack in species and all posses a variety of diets and the plants they feed from also vary and depend for each specimen. Most of the insects from this sub-family feed during daylight and have nectar as their primary food source while they're desperately searching for nectar the sticky pollen grains attach to the chafer and get carried from one flower to another and help in the fertilization of the seeds and allow the to turn into fruits, fruits are also consumed by certain species of flower chafers they are also considered as insect from the family Cetoniinae despite their habitual feeding. These fruit-feeding flower beetles are a mild (Not quite as serious) Pest in agricultural economy and the production of crops. Flower chafers are famously collected by entomologists and kept as household pests in some rare occasions. 

== Taxonomy ==
In the earliest taxonomic classifications of the Cetoniinae, the genera , Ichnestoma Xiphoscelis and Meridioclita were altogether classified under the the '''Xiphoscelidini.'''

== Habitat ==
Flower chafers love sunny grassy patches of flowers in meadows and field many of them can also be found in tropical, subtropical and lush green habitat however Flower chafers live in urban areas, forests and woodlands on most common occasions but that doesn't mean they aren't happy with urbanization. Flower chafers are found from central New South Wales to northern Queensland, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory and can only establish their population in areas with suitable flowers growing there.
