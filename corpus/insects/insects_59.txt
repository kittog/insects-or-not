This invasive species of honey bee originally came from africa and is much faster in swarms then the native European honey bees. They 

spead by invading other hives.

First they do a movment and get the other bees to let them in, then they get their queen into the hive and she lays her own eggs and they kill all the larvae and workers and take over the hive.
