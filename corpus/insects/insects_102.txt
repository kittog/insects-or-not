Cicadoidea
[[File:Cicada being held.jpg|thumb]]
The '''cicadas''' (/sɪˈkɑːdə/ or /sɪˈkeɪdə/) are a superfamily, the '''Cicadoidea''', of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha,[a] along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. It is divided into the Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and Cicadidae, with more than 1,300 species described from around the world; many undescribed species remain.

Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. They have an exceptionally loud song, produced not by stridulation, but by vibrating drum-like tymbals rapidly. The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees, feeding on sap, and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic, singing at night to avoid predators. The periodic cicadas spend most of their lives as underground nymphs, emerging only after 13 or 17 years, which may reduce losses by satiating their predators.

Cicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer's Iliad, and as motifs in art from the Chinese Shang dynasty. They have been used in myths and folklore to represent carefree living and immortality. Cicadas are eaten in various countries, including China, where the nymphs are served deep-fried in Shandong cuisine.
==Etymology==
The name is a direct derivation of the Latin cicada, meaning "tree cricket". American English of central Appalachia retains the name "jarfly".[1] In ancient Greek, it was called a tettix, and in modern Greek τζιτζίκας, tzitzikas—both names being onomatopoeic.
==Taxonomy and diversity==
Cicadas are arranged into two families: the Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae. The two extant species of Tettigarctidae include one in southern Australia and the other in Tasmania. The family Cicadidae is subdivided into the subfamilies Cicadinae, Tettigadinae, and Cicadettinae;[2] they are found on all continents except Antarctica. Some previous works also included a family-level taxon called the Tibiceninae. The largest species is the Malaysian emperor cicada ''[[Megapomponia imperatorial]]''; its wingspan is up to about 20 cm (8 in).[3] They are also notable for the great length of time some species take to mature.

At least 1300 cicada species are distributed worldwide with the majority being in the tropics. Most genera are restricted to a single biogeographical region and many species have a very limited range. This high degree of endemism has been used to study the biogeography of complex island groups such as in Indonesia and the Orient.[6] There are about 200 described species in Australia and New Zealand,[c] around 150 in South Africa, over 170 in America north of Mexico,[7] at least 800 in Latin America,[8] and over 200 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific.[9] About 100 species occur in the Palaearctic. A few species are found in southern Europe,[4] and a single species is in England, the New Forest cicada, ''Melampsalta montana'', which also occurs in continental Europe.[10]

Most of the North American species are in the genus ''[[Neotibicen]]'': the annual or jar fly or dog-day cicadas (so named because they emerge in late July and August).[11] The best-known North American genus, however, is ''[[Magicicada]]''. These periodical cicadas have an extremely long lifecycle of 13 or 17 years, suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers.[11]

Australian cicadas are found on tropical islands and cold coastal beaches around Tasmania, in tropical wetlands, high and low deserts, alpine areas of New South Wales and Victoria, large cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, and Tasmanian highlands and snowfields. Many of them go by common names such as cherry nose, brown baker, red eye, greengrocer, yellow Monday, whisky drinker, double drummer, and black prince. The Australian greengrocer, ''[[Cyclochila australasiae]]'', is among the loudest insects in the world.[12]

Forty-two species from five genera populate New Zealand, ranging from sea level to mountain tops, and all are endemic to New Zealand and the surrounding islands (Norfolk Island, New Caledonia).
===Palaeontology===
Fossil Cicadomorpha first appeared in the Upper Permian.[14] The superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families. The Upper Permian Dunstaniidae are found in Australia and South Africa, and also in younger rocks from China. The Upper Triassic Mesogereonidae are found in Australia and South Africa.

The Palaeontinidae or "giant cicadas" come from the Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous of Eurasia and South America.[15] The first of these was a forewing discovered in the Taynton Limestone Formation of Oxfordshire, England; it was initially described as a butterfly in 1873, before being recognized as a cicada and renamed ''Palaeontina oolitica''.
