<span lang="ga" dir="ltr">Hyles livornica, the '''striped hawk-moth''', is a moth of the family [[Sphingidae]].</span> 

==<span lang="ga" dir="ltr">Taxonomy</span>==
<span lang="ga" dir="ltr">Eugenius Johann Christoph Esper described the striped hawk-moth in 1780 using a specimen found in Italy at Livorno (hence the Latin name ''livornica''). In 1819 Jacob Hübner allocated this species in his newly erected genus ''Hyles''.</span>

<span lang="ga" dir="ltr">Until the 20th century ''Hyles livornica'' has been considered conspecific with the American ''Hyles lineata'' and is therefore under that name (or as ''Celerio lineata'' ssp. ''livornica'') found in the older literature. Similar was the case with the ''Hyles livornicoides'', which is prevalent in Australia. ''Hyles renneri'' from Nepal is sometimes treated as a valid species.</span>
