==Antlion==
Antlions are part of the Myrmeleontidae family and their likely genus is Myrmeleo. Antlion adults are sometimes called antlion lacewings. Antlion larva are often called a doodlebug, because of the tracks that the larva leave. The tracks are somewhat spiral-shaped and look as if someone "doodled' on the sand, hence the name doodlebug.[[File:Spider.jpg|thumb|A fully grown antlion.]]
