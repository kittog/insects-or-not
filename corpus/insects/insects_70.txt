Polistes carolina
This red polistes wasp is mostly like any other polistes wasp and is related to the polistes fuscatus, metricus and dorsalis. Another wasp close to polistes carolina is Polistes Perplexus, wich is another red colored wasp.

The perplexus has a more darker color then carolina, but their size and black colored wings are the same.

Polistes carolina males have curled antennae like all other polistes wasps, and a pale yellow face.

Males mate in the fall and new queens are prepared to hibernate.

An infertal female is a virgin that didn't mate and all ofspring will be male.

Male carolina wasps are born in fall and none in the spring.
