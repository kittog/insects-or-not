Drone ant
Drone ants are ants that have one task in life: to mate with a queen ant. A drone ant goes out in nuptial flights when it's the certain season (different for each species) and will mate with a winged queen. 2 days later the drone will curl up and die for other ants to eat but the queen can live for another 20 years.
