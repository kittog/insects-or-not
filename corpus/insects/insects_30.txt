{{Insects_Simple|title1=Thysania agrippina|image1=White witch moth.jpg|caption1=The largest known lepidopteran|order=Lepidoptera|family=[[Erebidae]]|genus=[[Thysania]]|species=T. agrippina|similar_species=[[Ascalapha odorata]]}}

The most commonly accepted English name is the white witch. Other common names include the '''ghost moth''', '''great grey witch''' and '''great owlet moth'''. The idea of the name "White witch" comes from the fact that entomologist were not able to collect any specimen using bullets in the medieval era!

== Morphology ==
With a gorgeous wingspan of 30 cm (16 Inches) Thysania agrppina is certainly the largest known lepidopterans, With the underside of the wings being darkened and painted in shades of brown with distinctive pale white markings forming an admirable tessellations on the wings of the white witch moth, the upper wings are painted with pale white colors with a similar tessellation as for the underside of the delicate scale-covered wings, the wings moth appears to have a tendency for dull colors concealing it amongst it's surrounding while perching on tree branches, these large lepidopterans are potentially invisible to predators.

== Region ==
The white witch flies '''over most of the New World tropics, from Argentina to Mexico, and occasionally as far north as Colorado in the United States'''. You would suppose that scientists must know the story of such an impressive organism. We don't have much information regarding the metamorphosis of the species currently.

== Diet ==
The White Witch Moth caterpillars eat '''legumes''', and favor acacia and mesquite. They are perfectly harmless, not an agricultural pest, and have no teeth or stingers.
