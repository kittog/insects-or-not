Colobopsis schmitzi
'''''Colobopsis schmitzi''''', synonym '''''Camponotus schmitzi''''', is a species of [[ant]] native to Borneo, which is commonly known as the '''diving ant''', '''swimming ant''' or '''pitcher-plant ant''', due to their habit of diving into the digestive fluids of their plant host ''Nepenthes bicalcarata''. They are endemic to the island of Borneo.

==Description==
''C. schmitzi'' closely resemble ''Colobopsis ceylonicus'' but are slightly larger. They have rectangular heads about one and a half times as long as they are wide. The mandibles have five teeth each (except for the minor workers which have four). The eyes are widely separated and located laterally, slightly behind the anterior bulge of the head. The antennae are short, with a scape at 1 mm (0.039 in) in length. The funicules are longer than they are wide proximally and become shorter and wider towards the tip. The body is smooth and shiny. The gaster is small. The legs are relatively large, especially the femurs, and very compressed laterally. Spines are present near the distal tip of the femurs and absent in the tibiae. The tarsi are longer than the tibiae.

''C. schmitzi'' exhibit polymorphism, with three physical castes - minor, median, and major ("soldier") workers. The queen averages at a length of 8 mm (0.31 in) with wings measuring 7 mm (0.28 in) long. The major and median workers are both 6.5 mm (0.26 in) in length, while the minor workers are 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in) long. They are brownish-yellow to reddish-orange in color; the head and gaster are darker than the rest of the body.

The larvae are typical of ''Camponotus'' larvae - cylindrical in shape with the head and mouthparts bent at a 90 degree angle from the body.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Colobopsis schmitzi'' inhabits the hollow tendrils of the plant ''Nepenthes bicalcarata''. It is only found in association with ''N. bicalcarata'', which is endemic to the island of Borneo.

==Taxonomy==
''Camponotus schmitzi'' is classified in the genus ''[[Colobopsis]]'', which was formerly treated as a subgenus of ''[[Camponotus]]'', tribe Camponotini, and subfamily Formicinae of the ant family Formicidae. It was first collected by the botanist Jan Pieter Schuitemaker and described by the myrmecologist August Stärcke in 1933 as ''Camponotus schmitzi''.
