== For hunting ==
In case of Arachnids such as jumping spiders, sand spiders and wolf spiders, pedipalps are an extra limb located near the mouth, it is used to grab the prey tightly and inject it with a harpoon of potent venom consuming it in the process. These "Extra" mouthparts are highly flexible joins and are greatly specialized for a particular task of sizing the prey into a simpler form which the predator itself can consume slowly.

== As stimulus ==
Some species have pedipalps covered with sensory hairs which allows them to be used for a secondary purpose which is the sense of touch and taste. These arachnids have poor eyesight, multipurpose pedipalps are common among tarantulas and other Larger spiders.
