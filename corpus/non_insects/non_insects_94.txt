=== Morphology ===
While not much is known about the species Chinchippus peruvianus. They are known to have a lighter coloration, larger size and different chelicerae in comparison with C. Viajaensis (The only other known Solifuge in genus Chinchippus described in 2009) as stated [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250062832_Natural_history_of_coastal_Peruvian_solifuges_with_a_redescription_of_Chinchippus_peruvianus_and_an_additional_new_species_Arachnida_Solifugae_Ammotrechidae here].

== Behaviour ==

=== Feeding Habits ===
It can be speculated that C. Peruvianus along with the other species in genus Chinchippus are predacious but may also exhibit scavenger hunting, feeding off carcasses and maritime fauna in respect to their coastal-Arid Habitat.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Size-distribution-of-Chinchippus-peruvianus-n-5-101-individuals-at-Cangrejal-Paracas_fig4_250062832</ref> they’re prey could include amphipods <ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250062832_Natural_history_of_coastal_Peruvian_solifuges_with_a_redescription_of_Chinchippus_peruvianus_and_an_additional_new_species_Arachnida_Solifugae_Ammotrechidae</ref>and seabird carcasses.

=== Other behaviours ===
It could also be presumed that c. Peruvianus tends to stay in burrows<ref>https://sites.google.com/site/acatenazzi/chinchippus</ref> , although it is worth mentioning that no other information is currently available on this article in regards to the specie’s behaviour.
