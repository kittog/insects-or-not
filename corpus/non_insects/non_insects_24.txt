==Description==
Males are a bit longer than 2 mm, females 5 mm.
==Distribution==
It was originally described from Bat Cave, Carter County, Kentucky and New Hampshire, and a year later found under rotten logs in a deep gorge at Ithaca, New York.[1]

''S. cavicolens'' is distributed over the eastern part of North America, south in the mountains of North Carolina. It is very closely related to ''S. paradoxum'' and other European species, but quite different from the other ''Sabacon'' species of the eastern US, the smaller ''S. mitchelli''.
