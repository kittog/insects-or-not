== Morphology ==
The House Centipede has a greyish-yellow coloration and has 15 pairs of legs and the maximum size is 20 cm. These legs enable them to reach speeds of up to 1.3 Feet per second along any surface capable of being grappled. They feature a pair of two long, extensive antennae capable of detecting chemical and tactile change in their surroundings, protruding from both their head and posterior. 

== Origins ==
Originally from the Mediterranean region, the species has spread to other parts of the world where it lives in people's homes, thus acquiring the name of "House Centipede".

== Ecology ==

=== Behavior ===
Behaviorally, House Centipedes are nomadic, drawn to the presence of prey and habitability, before searching elsewhere, even if conditions remain unchanged. They do not nest, and they do not parasitize a home's resources, instead devoting their focus to living prey.

When threatened, House Centipedes are non-confrontational unless cornered or physically trapped. Like other centipedes, they are capable of stridulating, producing clicks in order to deter predators and attracts mates. House Centipedes are capable of biting humans when threatened, although this is a rare occurrence, as they tend towards limb-sacrificing and fleeing before defending themselves. 

=== Food Sources ===
It is an insectivore that consumes other arthropods such as insects and arachnids. If anything, an abundance of House Centipedes is an indicator of a more serious arthropod infestation in one's home, although this doesn't leave these centipedes exempt from being intruders themselves, despite the fact that they do not nest or cause any tangible damage to property.

=== Defence mechanism ===
When threatened, House Centipedes are known to involuntarily detach legs much like a Harvestmen Spider in order to escape larger prey, or get themselves out of adhesive traps, sacrificing several limbs in order to continue living.

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Fff.jpg|thumb|233x233px]]Mating takes place in the spring and the females lay between 63-151 eggs.

== Bites ==
Their bites aren’t painful. They’re venom is ineffective on humans. They almost never bite humans. The worst case scenario, bites can cause a rash, nothing more itching and irritation lasts for 1-2 days on average. Large species can deliver a painful bite but not smaller centipedes.
