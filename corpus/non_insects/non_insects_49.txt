species of arachnid from the family [[Theridiidae]] residing in the Hawaiian islands.  Theridion grallator occurs in a wide range of polymorphisms, and also possesses a unique ability to temporarily change their exoskeleton’s colour respectively to various food items they consume.

== Morphology ==
With a size of less than 6 mm,  Theridion grallator is a minuscule, translucent lemon-yellow coloured spider with the hairy, thin needle-like fore and hind appendages being almost twice the body length. The main striking feature of  Theridion grallator is the pattern present on the abdomen, varying amongst one morph to another, the patters on their abdomens resemblance a smiling face hence the name happy face spider. The generals polymorphism consists of a difference in the patterns present on the abdomen varying from one specimen to another generally composed of irregular, black red and white patterns often resembling a grinning face. The coloration of their abdomen varies from lime green, lime, orange, vermillion, white or sulphur depending on their diet. 

== Life cycle ==

=== Reproduction ===
Female’s pregnancy lasts for a few weeks after completion. The female deposits an egg sac containing upto 250 eggs. The female loosens the silk encasing the eggs when they are about to hatch letting our baby  Theridion grallators. The female guards the eggs until they emerge.

=== Infants ===
The female remains within the close proximity of her young and feeds them as the spiderlings are unable to hunt for themselves. She encases prey in silk strings and traps them allowing her young to consume them. The females are not observed to consume anything during this stage.

==== Brood Adoption ====
upon the death of their parents young spiders may join another species of adult  Theridion grallator on the closest residential leaf. Females are often known to adopt orphaned, young  Theridion grallators.

== Feeding habits ==
This spider is known to camouflage amongst its surroundings. They do not built webs but rather wait for prey. They feed on long legged flies ( [[Dolichopodidae]] ) and cosmopolitan flies ([[Drosphilidae]])

=== Hunting ===
Theridion grallator detects the presence of prey via vibrations occurring on the residential leaf and are exceptionally capable of identifying prey or predators using vibrations. They built untidy, minuscule webs often messy or tangled.

== Geological distribution ==
They have been found on the islands of O’ahu, Moloka’i, Maui, generally in humid, moisture rich tropical to subtropical forests with an average rainfall between 200-360 mm. They reside on the underside of leaves of the Kanawao plant.
