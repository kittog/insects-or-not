==Description==
''Ornithodoros hermsi'' is a soft-bodied tick of the family Argasidae. It is one of the smallest ticks of the species ''[[Ornithodoros]]''.[2] Females are larger than the males.[3] ''O. hermsi'' has a multihost lifecycle,[1] and some females have been observed to live four years without any blood meals.[3] They are parasites of rodents and other small mammals. The most favored host is the western chipmunk, ''Eutamias'' spp.
==Lifecycle==
As do all other species of ticks, ''O. hermsi'' begin as eggs, then larvae, then nymphs, to adult ticks.[4] ''O. hermsi'' has two larval molts and three nymphal stages.[5] The nymphal blood meals and the greater volume of blood intake will increase the development from nymphs to adults and decrease the number of nymphal stages.
