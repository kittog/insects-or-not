== Morphology ==
Gigantometrus swammerdami is the largest known scorpion, some specimen are known to reach an astounding 23 cm in length.  Gigantometrus swammerdami is a rather attractive species of scorpion with a leathery, rigid exoskeleton. Their carapace is mainly reddish-black, occasionally brown the juveniles are usually brown with a yellow-coloured telson.  Gigantometrus swammerdami are known to weigh as much as 56 gm.  Manus completely covered by large rounded granulae, but without true carinae. Pedipalp patella lacks a pronounced internal tubercle. Carapace with a smooth disc in which the margins and posterior portion are granulate. Telson bulbous, and the vesicle longer than aculeus.<ref>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantometrus_swammerdami</ref> They have 16-20 comb-like teeth known as [[Pectinal teeth]].

== Ecology ==

=== Hunting ===
G. Swammerdami has evolved in such as way to not be reliant on their toxic secretions <ref>https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/340922-Heterometrus-swammerdami</ref>but rather use their impressive, large pincers to crush and tear apart their prey, the peak hunting season for this species usually occurs during mid-summers. Known for being both Nocturnal but can rarely be found during daytime. <ref>https://factanimal.com/giant-forest-scorpion/</ref>This solitary species rise from their burrows during late evening and hunting sessions can last overnight [Critation needed]. They may also use their pectinal teeth to locate chemical trails left behind by their prey in a manner similar to desert centipedes.<ref>https://factanimal.com/giant-forest-scorpion/</ref>

==== Feeding ====
They usually feed on a large array of animals most notable ones include smaller arachnids, insects and possibly even small mammals such as mice.

=== Courtship & maternal care ===
As with most scorpions, this species is ovoviviparous and give birth to live young. The courtship “dance” is exhibited by this species or not remains as an unanswered question . Females show maternal care, carrying the infants on her back until their exoskeleton hardens. 

== Geological distribution ==

=== Range ===
The species ranges from Sri Lanka to the western ghats of India.<ref>https://factanimal.com/giant-forest-scorpion/</ref>

=== Habitat ===
The habitats for this species usually occurs in either moderate-temperature areas to tropical rainforests. This species can be found in the Tropical-wet monsoon zone of India.
