Eriophyes tiliae
[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]'''''Eriophyes tiliae''''' is a [[mite]] that forms the lime nail gall or bugle gall.[2] It develops in a chemically induced gall; an erect, oblique or curved distortion rising up from the upper surface of the leaves of the common lime (US: linden) tree Tilia × europaea (synonym T. × vulgaris).
==The physical appearance==
During late spring and summer, tubular growths up to 5 millimetres (0.20 in) long develop on the upper surface of lime tree leaves. These galls may be yellow-green or red in color, may be very numerous, and predominantly occur on the lower leaves in some sub-species.
==Taxonomy==
Several sub-species have been identified, partly identified by their positioning on the leaves in relation to the veins and other structures.
