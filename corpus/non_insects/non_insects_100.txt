==Geographical range==
''Androctonus'' is widespread in North and West Africa, the Middle East and eastwards to the Hindukush region. Countries where ''Androctonus'' species live include: Armenia, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Togo, Palestine, Israel, India, Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bahrain and Pakistan.
==Etymology==
A rough English translation of the name ''Androctonus'' is "man-killer", from the Greek andras (άνδρας), meaning "man" and kteinein (κτείνειν), meaning "to kill". ''Crassicauda'' means fat-tailed, from the Latin crassus meaning "thick" or "fat" and cauda, meaning "tail". ''Androctonus crassicauda'' is widespread throughout the Middle East and its name means "fat-tailed man-killer". Similarly, the Latin word for South is australis, from which ''Androctonus australis'', "southern man-killer", derives.
