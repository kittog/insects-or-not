==Description==
In the females of ''Micrommata ligurina'' the body length can reach 9–14 millimetres (0.35–0.55 in), while in the males it is about 6–9 millimetres (0.24–0.35 in).[4] The carapace is long and narrow and the abdomen is elongate. The cephalothorax and the long legs of the females are bright green, with a lighter green abdomen showing an almost indistinct median band. [4]

This spider is very similar to the green huntsman spider (''Micrommata virescens''), but the females have a black dot on the carapace. Moreover the adult males of 'M. ligurina'' have a dark brown median band on abdomen with whitish or gray sides. [4]

The eight eyes are arranged in two rows and surrounded by white hairs. Adults can be found in late winter and in early spring.
==Distribution==
''Micrommata ligurina'' occurs from the Mediterranean Basin to Central Asia. [1][2] The range of this species includes Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Malta, Portugal, Romania and Spain.
