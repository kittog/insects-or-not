[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]'''Tetragnatha extensa''' is a species of [[spider]] found across the Northern Hemisphere. It has an elongate body, up to 11 mm (0.43 in) long, and adopts a straight line posture when alarmed. It lives on low vegetation in damp areas, and feeds on flying insects which it catches in its web.
==Description==
''T. extensa'' has an elongated, cream-colored body.[1] Males are smaller than females, at around 9 millimetres (0.35 in) body length, compared to 11 mm (0.43 in) for females.[2] The four pairs of legs are very long,[1] and are dark yellow.[3] The carapace, which is around 1.8–2.6 mm long and 1.1–1.7 mm wide, is orange or dark yellow.

The coloring of ''T. extensa'' is quite variable,[4] ranging from creamy-yellow to green.[2] On the underside, there is a thick black central band, with a silvery band on either side.[3]

''T. extensa'' is distinguished from other members of the genus ''Tetragnatha'' by the minute curved tip of the male's conductor (part of the pedipalp), and the form of the female's spermatheca.
==Distribution==
''T. extensa'' has a wide distribution across the Northern Hemisphere (Holarctic).

In North America, it is found from Alaska to Newfoundland, and its range extends south to Washington, Colorado and Pennsylvania.[3] The species has a broad ecological range, having been found at the tree line in the Rocky Mountains.

It is found in coastal vegetation in Europe.[3] ''T. extensa'' is found throughout the United Kingdom,[2] where it is the commonest species of ''Tetragnatha'',[4] and one of the commonest spiders.[1] It is also found in Madeira.
