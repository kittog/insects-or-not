Together with the related species ''T. longior'', it is commonly referred to as the '''mold mite'''[1] or the '''[[cheese mite]]'''.
==Ecology==
In the wild, ''T. putrescentiae'' occurs throughout the world in a wide range of habitats, including "grasslands, old hay, mushrooms, and the nest of bees and ducks".[1] Under ideal conditions, with temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) and humidity above 85%, it can complete its life cycle in under three weeks.[1]

It is a common pest of stored products, especially those with a high protein and fat content (meat, cheese, nuts and seeds, dried eggs, etc.).[1] It feeds on the fungi that grow on the foodstuffs, and can become a pest of mycology laboratories.
==Human health==
''Tyrophagus putrescentiae'' has been identified as the cause of human disease in different regions. It has been found to cause copra itch among people who handle copra in the tropics, skin and respiratory allergies among people handling raw hams in Italy, and dermatitis in an Austrian butcher's shop.
