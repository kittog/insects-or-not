[[File:Brevipalpus_phoenicis.jpg|thumb|212px|''[[Brevipalpus phoenicis]]'' ]]A '''Mite''' is a tiny [[arachnid]] that may be microscopic depending on the species. Some common mites you may see could be [[spider mite]]s. A mite has 8 legs like most arachnids and can be severe pests to crop and plants. They share the same order as [[tick]]s: [[Acari]]. Mites live throughout the world, but some live in houses.
