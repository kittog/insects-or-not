It is native to India and Sri Lanka.
==Description==
As usual in spider morphology, the female is much larger than male, where the female is about 8-9mm in total length and the male is 7-9mm in length.
==Ecology==
Heavy bodied jumper spiders can be seen commonly among foliage and within tree trunks. They construct oval, thick silken webs on the underside of leaves, such as the leaf spikes of coconut trees.[2] During the daytime, the sac is uninhabited, and when night falls, the male occupies the sac. But sometimes, it was found that the female also inhabited it on several nights.
