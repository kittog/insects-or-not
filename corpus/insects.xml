Coccinella Septempunctata, or commonly known as '''Seven-Spot Ladybug''' is a species of [[Coccinellidae|coccinelid]] from the subfamily [[Coccinellinae]].

== Morphology ==
C. Septempunctata has vivid scarlet elytron speckled with seven matt-black spots, the first one is present on apical halves of the elytrons forming a joint between the two elytra, the second spot is present within the center of the elytron adjacent to the third spot, the fourth spot is located near the margin of the elytra adjacent to the fifth spot. The sixth and seventh spots are adjacent to fifth and fourth spots and to one another, the forth and fifth spots are present above the sixth and seventh spots, Adults are known to reach lengths between 7.6 - 12.7 cm. Their noticeable colorations make them un-appealing to predators. The adult's abdomen is black with two black spots present adjacent to one another.

== Seasonal History ==
This section is a stub due to lack information sources, please help insect wiki by inserting more valid information to this section!

== Biology ==
C. Septempunctata was introduced to UK as a biological means of non-chemical pest control due to their diet which mainly compromises of Aphids and other smaller insects, C. Septempunctata are vulnerable to becoming a prey for Harmonia axyridis (Harlequin Ladybug) The seven-spot ladybug is now widely used as pest-control agent to control aphid populations all over the world, They are a reliable means of non-chemical pest control and exceptionally helpful for farms, Greenhouses and gardens.

== Ecology ==

=== Food Sources &amp; Diet ===
Adult and Infant C. Septempunctata feed on aphids and Imago are also known to occasionally feed on nectar &amp; pollen grains from flowers.

== Geolocation ==
C. Septempunctata are known to be found worldwide with the exception of Antarctica and some isolated remote areas. Large Populations are found in humid climatic mainly Asia &amp; America.

'''Ladybugs''' also called ladybirds are infamously known as one of the most beneficial insects to agriculture and gardens due to their metabolism which compromises of pests. They generally and commonly eat [[Aphid|aphids]], [[Scale insect|scale insects]] and [[whiteflies]]. They can be found in Tropical and sub-tropical regions however they have a furthermore wider distribution is urban habitat this is so because they have adapted themselves to urbanization. 

== Morphology ==

=== Adult (imago) ===
Coccinellids have a vibrant coloration ranging from orange, yellow, vermillion, golden, red and scarlet. Their exoskeletons are painted with such bright irisedescent colorations are presents for a good reason, that is to warn predators about their defense mechanism and their unpleasent taste hence many predators often tend to avoid consuming them. They have a variety of tesselations present on their elytron normally circular patterns ranging in quantity from 1-20 circular in most cases, some species have parallel stripes and some have irregular patterns while some do not possess any.  They generally have white and black thoracic regions. Their inner fine-veined wings used for flight are normally tinted either black or grey. 

=== Juvenile ===
In their juvenile forms, they spend their lives on leaves of plants, their diet are the same as the adults feeding on soft-bodied insects, the larva's bodies are divided into ring-like segements with a range in quantity from 10-30 and have 3 pairs of legs, unlike other coleopterans, Coccinellids spend most of their lives above-ground prone to wild predators.

== Behaviors ==
The majority of coccinellid species are generally considered beneficial insects, because many species prey on herbivorous hemipterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests. Many coccinellids lay their eggs directly in aphid and scale insect colonies in order to ensure their larvae have an immediate food source. However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, the most prominent are of the subfamily [[Epilachninae]] (which includes the [[Mexican bean beetle]]), which are herbivorous themselves. Usually, epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating the leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can increase exponentially in years when their natural enemies, such as [[Apocephalus borealis|parasitoid wasps]] that attack their [[eggs]], are in fewer numbers. In such situations, they can do major crop damage. They occur in practically all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical countries.

=== Defense mechanism ===
The vibrant bright coloration serves a purpose as well, their ability to defend themselves from predators is called "Reflex bleeding" Where a yellow-colored, foul smelling chemical is poured out of the regional joints that connect the thorax and the head, this chemical is enough to make predators un-satisfied and disgusted. The substance's color varies in each species and so does it's composition.

== Misconceptions ==
A common false fact which has'nt even been proven, is that the number of spots on the insect's back indicates its age. In fact, the underlying pattern and colouration are determined by the species and genetics of the beetle, and develop as the insect matures. In some species its appearance is fixed by the time it emerges from its pupa, though in most it may take some days for the colour of the adult beetle to mature and stabilise. Generally, the mature colour tends to be fuller and darker than the colour of the callow.

== Defination ==
Cetoniinae compromises of flower chafers this order has 4000 described species but more than an additional half is currently undiscovered, Flower chafers help in pollination of fruits and flowers and fertilize them (Although some species feed on them) , most of them are diurnal and have a wide array of colors and a lustrous exoskeleton, their Habitual action has one thing in particular kept in great quantities and yes, it is pollination. Some species also feed on fruit and are regarded as a mild threat to agricultural economical production.

== Appearance ==
While visiting you local garden many people must've seen a glare of light being reflected by something perching upon a flower, that is not what it seems, instead it is a flower chafer, this is one of their most remarkably known feature, a lustrous and shiny [[exoskeleton]] that will reflect light and their colors varying according to the propagation of light and the pattern of the light falling onto it's [[exoskeleton]]. Flower chafer are remarkably known for helping in pollination and show all the features that are shown by any ordinary specimen belonging to the family [[polyphaga]], and that is the absence of the '''notopleural''' suture (can be observed underneath the pronotal shield) also another important thing is that the hind [[coxa]] (base of the leg), is conjoint and does not intact the first and second abdominal and ventral cavities (known as sternites) Flowers chafers vary in colors ranging from green to golden to vermillion and violet.

== Food ==
[[File:Cetonia aurata pisana.JPG|thumb|221x221px|[[Cetonia aurata pisana]]]]
Cetoniinae certainly does not lack in species and all posses a variety of diets and the plants they feed from also vary and depend for each specimen. Most of the insects from this sub-family feed during daylight and have nectar as their primary food source while they're desperately searching for nectar the sticky pollen grains attach to the chafer and get carried from one flower to another and help in the fertilization of the seeds and allow the to turn into fruits, fruits are also consumed by certain species of flower chafers they are also considered as insect from the family Cetoniinae despite their habitual feeding. These fruit-feeding flower beetles are a mild (Not quite as serious) Pest in agricultural economy and the production of crops. Flower chafers are famously collected by entomologists and kept as household pests in some rare occasions. 

== Taxonomy ==
In the earliest taxonomic classifications of the Cetoniinae, the genera , Ichnestoma Xiphoscelis and Meridioclita were altogether classified under the the '''Xiphoscelidini.'''

== Habitat ==
Flower chafers love sunny grassy patches of flowers in meadows and field many of them can also be found in tropical, subtropical and lush green habitat however Flower chafers live in urban areas, forests and woodlands on most common occasions but that doesn't mean they aren't happy with urbanization. Flower chafers are found from central New South Wales to northern Queensland, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory and can only establish their population in areas with suitable flowers growing there.

The Trypoxylus dichotomus is a very common East Asian beetle in the [[Dynastinae]] subfamily.

== Overview ==

=== Etymology ===
In Japanese, rhinoceros beetles are called ''kabutomushi'' (かぶとむし, also written 甲虫 or かぶと虫). ''Mushi'' is Japanese for insect, and ''kabuto'' is Japanese for helmet, literally referring to the samurai helmet. The beetle's Korean name meaning 'Jangsupungdeng-i(장수풍뎅이, "General beetle") is similar in nature but it sounds completely different. In Chinese the beetle is called '獨角仙' (which translates to 'single-horned immortal') or '雙叉犀金龜'.

== Biology ==

===Appearance===

The Rhinoceros beetle has a pale maroon exoskeleton coated with a an iridescent shine. Male specimen have large Y shaped horns that pronge into two smaller thorns at the end, A smaller horn is present at the top of the thoracic plate wihich pronges into two smaller ones. Horns can range in size and shape These are used to defeat other beetles or to plow through tough soil or stone. Females do not obtain horns. The males can reach lengths of 40-80 mm (excluding the horns) The Tibia and tarsus are coated densely with sharp spikes that end with a pair of sickle-end claws on each limb in females, the apex of the abdomen is aligned with rows of spikes. the larva ave pale white bodies with  bodies composed of  several ring-like segments with three pairs of brown legs and a dark-brown bulbous head.

=== Metamorphosis ===
The females lay their eggs in either rotting wood or underground where they reside in their larval stage feeding off rotting wood of trees and timber. the males die during Autumn and so do the females during late fall, The larva spend their lives as a juvenile overwinter emerging as an adult during middle to late spring. 

===Habitat===

They can be seen borrowing in rotting wood or basking on rocks in Japan, South-East Asia and are now imported to other countries such as United Kingdom. They are an extremely successful species with estimated to be over 100 annual generations.

== Culture ==
Many children in Japan buy or catch these beetles and breed them. Male and female insects will cost about 500 to 1000 yen (approximately five to ten US dollars).This beetle is sold as a pet in department stores in many countries of Asia where it is also frequently depicted in popular media

The Dynastes hercules is a species in the family [[Dynastinae]].

==Appearance==

The Hercules beetle has a very long horn, making it the longest beetle in the world. It has a yellow shell and translucent wings. The body has an oval shape and there are tiny dots scattered around the shell.

Many mistaken the Hercules Beetle as the largest beetle in the world. However, it is obviously beaten by [[Goliathus goliatus]].

==Habitat==

Hercules beetles live in dry leaves or on tree branches. It is not too predatory, however, it can carry 3 kilograms easily or 850 times its own weight. As an adult, it searches harvested fruit dropped on the ground. In its pupal stage, it eats decaying or old wood.

The Hercules is not used as a pet, but actually for selling or collecting.

Polyphaga is the most diverse sub-family of beetles which currently contains over 35000 species, 144 families and 24 super families. However more new species are being discovered every day The name of ''polyphaga'' is derived from two Greek words: '''''poly'''-'', meaning 'many', and '''''phagein''''', meaning 'to eat', hence they're suborders are called “eaters of many things”. There are certain key characterstics that are only possesed by Polyphagia and that are the absence of the '''[[notopleural]]''' suture (can be observed underneath the [[pronotal shield]]) also another important thing is that the hind [[coxa]] (base of the leg), is conjoint and does not intact the first and second [[abdominal and ventral cavities]] (known as [[sternites]]).

Polyphaga makes up 90% Of all the [[Coleoptera families|coleopteran families]], A diverse range of species from this order are normally [[plant eaters]], their diet includes algae, moss, plant tissues, [[pollen]] and sometimes lichen can also be a part of their diet. The nutrition-rich food they need in order to survive varies from each family to another family and their food habits will also vary from place to place. [[Woodworm|Furniture beetles]] (Woodworms) are a huge household pest due to their habits of chewing wood as a larva that they are only capable of digesting through really powerful stomach acids present within their intestines. They do posses an elytra however they only use it upon feeling threatened by something or someone. Next we have lady bugs on the list (''[[Coccinellidae]]'') they help farmers regrow their crops and repair the damage caused by [[Cicadas,leafhoppers and aphids|aphids]] which their diet primarily includes however some species of ladybirds are herbivorous and can cause serious damage in large numbered-infestations. next on our list is longhorn beetles ([[Cerambycidae]]) They eat plants especially hardwood trees, maple, ash, pine and Oakwood is their favorite food, they eat is as a juvenile and as an adult they got their name due to the popular belief that they are humans transformed into a beetle with long antennae. Weevils are just the same with a different name, they belong to the family [[Curculionoidea]] and have elongated proboscis to penetrate through tree trunks and fruits to lay their [[eggs]]. They are too gross to be shown through real images! And they certainly win the award for the second worst pest in ecological imbalance. [[Fireflies]] look really pretty with their own night lights shimmering bright, they feed off [[Termite|small bugs]] as a [[Larva|juvenile]] but have a much darker side as an adult, so some male fireflies eat others and are cannibalistic they can only be seen far away from urbanizations in tropical areas. Scarabs and stag beetles feed on plants and some species are remarkably huge and gigantic in their size and scarabs are considered to be sacred as per Egyptian mythology due to the fact that they mysteriously appear and disappear into the ground and the way they roll bung represents how earth moves around sun. Dung beetles collect dung and lay their eggs inside it, both the juvenile and the adults feed on animal wastes if they are ever hungry and keep the environment sanitary and clean. (Yuck!) next and the last beetles from the major families on our list are rove beetles and water scavengers, most water "scavengers" are scavengers and feed on dead corpses f insects that've drowned and keep their ponds clean this way only. Rove beetles are normally omnivores.

Megasoma elephas is a very heavy beetle in the family [[Dynastinae]].

==Appearance==

The Elephant Beetle is pretty large by weight and by size. The main colour of the Elephant is yellow. There are horns on the side like the [[Goliath Beetle]]. One very large horn resembles a hook and an elephant trunk, hence the name. 

==Habitat==

Elephant Beetle larvae develop in large decaying logs and take up to four years to develop into adult beetles. The female lays her eggs inside the decaying log. After about 3 weeks, the eggs hatch into C-shaped larva, white grubs with brown heads and six legs. The larval stage lasts 30 weeks, during which the grubs consume organic matter. The third and last stage, the pupal stage, lasts around 5 weeks at a temperature of 25°C. The life span of an adult Elephant Beetle is around four months. Elephant beetles eat spiny fruit on the coast like lychee or pineapple. Elephants are nocturnal.

Goliathus orientalis is a Goliath beetle in the family [[Scarabaeidae]].

==Appearance==

This Goliath beetle has a patterned shell and brown wings with an outline of blue. The eyes are clearly visible and the head has a striking black pattern. The horns are more like pencil erasers and the legs have hazel hair growing on the sides. They also have sharp claws for grabbing things.

Orientalis differs from [[Goliathus regius|Regius]] because of the pattern. Orientalis has more whiteness and has a different pattern.

==Habitat==

The Goliath Beetle usually enjoys climbing branches - or what looks like a branch - like the rest of the family. The beetle grabs dead leaves on palm trees for its source of protein. Adults sip sugar substances from fruits and palm trees, which is most likely coconut.

Goliath beetles are the jewel of a beetle collector. They can range from 50,000-60,000 Yen (Japan has many Goliaths) and are sold without their legs. The value increases if the wings are open.

Cetonia Aurata, commonly known as '''The green rose chafer''' or '''Rose chafer.''' Is a 

Scarabaeoid beetle of the genus [[Cetoniinae|Cetonia]].

== Morphology ==
With a striking metallic green exoskeleton with the luster of a golden tint, their appearance can often be misled as for [[Agestrata luzonica]]. C. Aurata may be one of the nature's truly admirable artworks. The propagation of light and the reflection of light affects the colors seen by a human eye ranging from a mix of red, golden, blue, olive green and violet luster. C. Aurata reaches about 20 mm at maximum in adulthood, the underside of the beetle is a coppery-brown colour.  The antennae are lamellate with the last articles that can be spread apart or joined like the pages of a book. C. Aurata can be. Distinguished by the triangular scutellum which sits, adjoining both elytron with the thorax ; have a broad, oblong body.

=== Iridescence ===
The metallic green coloration of the beetle is created structurally, caused by the reflection of mostly circularly polarised light; like other scarabs this is left circularly polarised. When viewed through a right circular polariser, the beetle appears to be colorless. There are also different colors besides the common green; there is also copper, grey and black. A lot of specimens have white speckles while some have very few or none at all.  It has been described as a left-hand narrow-band elliptical polarizer.

== Biology ==

=== Life cycle &amp; Activity ===
Mating occurs in the spring and eggs are laid among compost or in decaying trees during June and July, after which the females die. 
[[File:Cetonia aurata (4).jpeg|thumb|Larvae]]
[[File:Cetonia aurata (2).png|thumb]]

==== Infancy ====
The larvae grow quickly and will moult twice before the winter; they take two years to become fully grown and will pupate from June to August in a subterranean cell in humus-rich soil or among compost or tree-trunk detritus. Larvae have been found in plant pots, feeding on the compost etc. but apparently not harming the plants. . The larvae are typically scarabaeiod; C-shaped with a firm and soft body, small head and large hind body and tiny legs, they are distinguished from other U.K. chafer larvae in having pink head and legs and transverse rows of reddish hairs along the body. They reach 3.5cm when fully grown. They often occur in large numbers among organic matter and are beneficial in breaking down compost and decaying wood. Unlike the larvae of some chafers they do not feed on roots.

==== Pupation ====
[[File:Cetonia aurata (3).png|thumb|A specimen demonstrating the pupae and the pupation chamber]]

===== Pupal chambers =====
The mature larva prepares a roundish pupal chamber, with a greater diametre of about 3 cm, cementing the earthy particles with faeces and salivary secretions. Inside it takes place the metamorphosis transforming in a pupa of adecto type, almost completely motionless.

===== Emergence =====
The adult, after staying for some time in the pupal chamber, with its robust legs opens a passage and rises to the surface. Adults eclose from August and a few become active in the autumn but the majority remain in the pupal cell until the following spring, emerging when the temperature reaches about 15°C; ; the pupae may be found in the same habitats, encrusted in a covering of compost or woody material

==== Adulthood ====
The adults become active in May, flying in the afternoon and evening, due to their habits of feeding off organic plant matter such as a variety of fruits, they, some years are so serious as pests that baited traps are available to help control their numbers.

=== Food plants ===
The adults can be observed feeding upon pollen and nectar in a wide range of flowers including umbels, honeysuckle and viburnum but they seem particularly fond of Elder and roses. They may sometimes be seen in numbers flying around the tops of small trees and shrubs towards the evening. On the continent they sometimes feed on soft fruits including peaches and apricots, chewing holes into the fruit and feeding under the skin

=== Defence mechanism ===
Uric and formic acid impregnate the internal organs and in defense these acids are also excreted externally from the anal cavity, so that using a chemical strategy, the insect is nauseating and not at all attractive to predators.

=== Predation ===
This beetle is however controlled at the larval level by some natural parasites that keep the population stable: among these we remember some mushrooms of the genus Sporotricum, [[Wasps|scoliid wasps]] and numerous [[diptera]].

== Ecological role ==

=== In Agriculture ===
Rose chafer is an insect that in the adult state feeds on nectar and sugary substances, also acting as a good pollinator. Occasionally they can cause damage only in some types of flowers (such as roses) that have reproductive organs hidden and inaccessible. In this case, to reach the nectar they ruin the rest of the flower, also because they are quite bulky. They are also attracted to the sap that oozes from the injured broadleaf trunks.

=== Symbolism ===
Cetonia aurata is one of the most important symbols of Egyptian culture, where it was depicted with wings folded to represent the neophyte and with open wings to symbolize the initiate who took flight to knowledge.

== Subtaxa ==

=== Subspecies ===

* C. a. sicula &lt;small&gt;Aliquo, 1983&lt;/small&gt; (Sicily)
* C.a. jingkelii &lt;small&gt;Flutsch &amp; Tauzin, 2009&lt;/small&gt; (China.)
* C. a. pallida &lt;small&gt;(Drury, 1773)&lt;/small&gt; (eastern Mediterranean, Turkey and Asia Minor.)
* [[Cetonia aurata pisana|C. a. pisana]] &lt;small&gt;Heer, 1841&lt;/small&gt; (Western Europe) 
* C. a. pokornyi &lt;small&gt;Rataj, 2000&lt;/small&gt; (Western Siberia.)
* [[Cetonia aurata viridiventris|C. a. vridiventris]] &lt;small&gt;Reitter, 1896&lt;/small&gt; (Kazakhstan and Southern Siberia)

== Distribution ==

=== Range ===
occurs throughout southern and central Europe north to southern Scandinavia and the U.K. and east to Turkey and Ukraine. At least 6 subspecies have been described, the distribution of which is sometimes sympatric with the typical subspecies, and there are many named colour varieties; almost 40 in France alone.

=== Habitat ===
The preferred habitat for C. Aurata generally includes foliated woodland areas exposed to plentiful sunlight, generally deciduous forest slopes, sunny and warm patches of grassland ;meadows and urban habitat such as parks, fields, gardens etc. general habitat for this species include a few major features such as ample availability of food and sunlight. They usually prefer temperature not too high or low but moderate.

'''''Dorcus titanus''''' is a beetle of the family Lucanidae. It was described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1835. This species is widely distributed in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, India, Japan, China, Taiwan and Korea.

== Morphology ==
Males can grow upto 32.0–111.3 millimetres (1.26–4.38 in) if we include mandibles. Females have been known to reach lengths of approximately 36.5–54 millimetres (1.44–2.13 in). They have an elongated and flat body with a metallic black colored exoskeleton. The Males have large and thick scissor-like pair of antlers that are aligned with several teeth that can penetrate through wood and provide an excellence at rivalry battles. An unusual thing about Dorcus titanus is the enormous head of a large male which has been recorder to reaches nearly the astounding length of its prothorax and abdomen combined.

== Metamorphosis ==
Dorcus titanus undergoes a complete metamorphosis. Adults can be seen from May to August during the late months of summers to Spring. They tend to feed on sap from trees, what allows them to do so is their large and powerful mandibles with their amazing vitality whenever it comes to rivalry. The main target for Dorcus titanus includes ''Quercus'' species of plants. Females lay eggs on the underground among the roots of a matured Oak tree. The eggs hatch within an approximate time period of about a month and the larvae feed on rotten wood as they reside themselves among the roots of the host plant. The larval period lasts about one year it will pupate among the roots and emerge as an adult during early summers. The complete life cycle can last approximately from 1 to 2 years.

'''''Synanthedon exitiosa''''' or the '''Peachtree borer''' is a black species of [[moth]] in the family [[Sesiidae]].

==Appearance==

The most noticeable feature of Exitosa is the broad orange stripe on the body. The wings are slightly tinted to blue with transparent blotches on the wings. and the body is coated black. This is a specialized method of mimicry to prevent unsuspecting predators from consuming them, It is indeed true that this moth mimics wasp (Although it is harmless) as a method of preventing larger insects and birds from consuming them. It has been known to attack ''Prunus persica'' and Rosaceae species of plants, a family of fruit bearing trees. The wingspan of Exitiosa ranges from 14 mm to 33 mm, and are noticeable between May and September. The adult female of the species has a wingspan of about 3.5 centimeters. . It has opaque forewings and clear hindwings. The male is smaller and more slender, and both pairs of wings are clear. The larva is up to 3.5 centimeters long and white with a brown head.

==Habitat==

[[Acherontia lachesis]]|image1=Deathsheadmoth.jpg}}
== Acherontia atropos ==
Acherontia atropos, more commonly known as the African Death's head hawk-moth and sometimes known as a bee robber, is a large hawkmoth which originates from the [[Sphingidae]] family. It is found throughout the British Isles, Europe and the African continent.

==Morphology==
Their wings are mottled dark brown alongside black marking on the wings in addition to the pale brown blotches on the forewings. The hindwings are mustard-yellow with parallel black line with faint black venations. The undersides of the wing are dotted with mustard yellow scales with the edges being dull yellow. All wings have visible black venation with a few larger ones near the edges.

The rest of the moth is coloured mottled dark brown or black, with the abdomen being grey with black stripes, flanked with yellow stripes on the outer parts. The most distinctive feature is of course the arrangement of brown scales on the thorax forming a shape resembling a human skull. The abdomen is aligned with stripes of an orangish-buff coloration with a larger black stripe intersecting with all the others running vertically.

A recent study in 2020 shows that if viewed upside down, this moth resembles a head with eyes, with the skull pattern being the "nose". This is most likely to scare of small predators like birds, bats or other small mammals.

The species shows sight sexual dimorphism, as in most [[Lepidoptera]]. Female moths of this species tend to be larger than males, appearing bulkier and sporting larger, more robust abdomens. The abdomen of a male ''Acherotia atropos'' is less broad, with a pointed distal (lower) abdominal segment. In contrast, the females of the species have a distal abdominal segment that is rounded off at the tip. Antennae seen on a male are thinner and shorter than the antennae seen on a female. There are no pattern or colour changes related to the sex of an ''A. atropos''.

The caterpillar of the African death's-head hawkmoth is also sturdy and somewhat variable in colour, being some shade of buff, green or brown, with seven diagonal blue lines. At the rear is a curved, thorn-like horn. It can attain a length of 5 to 6 in (13 to 15 cm). The other two species of death's-head hawkmoth similarly have three larval colour forms: typically, green, brown and yellow. The pupa is stout and reddish-brown, and is formed 8 to 10 in (20 to 25 cm) under the ground in a dug chamber.

== Behavior ==
The behaviors shown by ''Acherontia atropos'' are quite unusual for any other lepidopteran. Not only it is the fact that ''Acherontia atropos'' consumed honey by breaking into beehives and aren't affected by bee stings due to their extra-fluffy bodies (''A. Styx'' is not as well-protected and sometimes gets stung to death). They indeed do have a pharnyx which is an incredibly rare thing seen among arthropods, and they used it to emit a squeaky noise that frightens predators (this might also be used for communication, but this is not known). 

These moths, as well as similar species excel at raiding beehives. They are incredibly strong and bulky, enough to not get affected by bee venom. They use their extra-long proboscis to drink the nectar of blossoms and the sweet scented honey they are addicted with. There is also a theory that the squeaks the moth produces mimic the queen's hence resulting in the bees to become purely docile. The moth smells like a bee as well, so they are not likely to be attacked by the hive. 

Caterpillars of this species are also quite aggressive. They reach 5-6 inches (13-15 cm) in length when fully grown and have a tail horn at their rear end covered with hard spikes. They have an irregular yellow pattern speckled with brown. They produce a clicking sound with their mandibles when disturbed and sometimes attempt to bite. They are usually found on potato and tomato plants. 

==Habitat==
''Acherontia atropos'' occurs throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean region, much of Africa down to the southern tip, and increasingly as far north as southern Great Britain due to recently mild British winters. It occurs as far east as India and western Saudi Arabia, and as far west as the Canary Islands and Azores. It invades western Eurasia frequently, although few individuals successfully overwinter.

It bears common names such as Mariposa de la Muerte (Butterfly of Death) in Mexico, Duppy Bat (Lost Soul) in Jamaica, or Sorciére Noire (or Dark Sorcerer) in French-speaking Caribbean islands.

==Folklore==
According to folklore, if the black witch flies into your field of view, it conveys a curse from an enemy. If it flies over your head, it will cause your hair to fall out. If it flies into your home when you are sick, you will not get well. You will die.

​​​On a happier note, if the black witch appears before you after someone has died, it represents the soul of the person returning to bid you farewell. Should one alight on you, you will become rich.

Should one land above the door of your home, you will win the lottery.

Unlike the butterflies - colorful and delicate nymphs of the daylight hours - the moths - drab spirits of the night - often recall humankind’s mysterious and darker side.

==Description==
The male Black Witch Moth has superficial resemblance to a small bat. It has a wingspan of up to 6 inches. Its wings are broad along insect’s head and body; pointed at the ends; often tattered by rigors of migratory flight. The proboscis is coiled, straw-like, used for taking nectar from flowers or liquids from other sources. Thier wings are brown with undulating dark brown or black lines; single black-outlined ‘9’-shaped mark near leading edge of each of its forewings; single black-outlined umbrella-shaped mark near trailing edge of each of its hindwings; marks distinguished by iridescent violent tinges.

Females are slightly larger than the male; distinguished by wavy white line traversing its wings.
==Occurrence==
The insect’s range extends from northern South America across Caribbean islands, Central America and Mexico and throughout the United States. In some locations, the moths breed throughout the year, in overlapping generations.

Some populations migrate seasonally, with those of the tropical regions heading north during rainy seasons. Mexican populations, for instance, head north into the Southwest during the summer. Like other migratory moths, the Black Witch flies only at night, well above ground level. It may travel considerable distances, even across open water.

The Black Witch stages occasional mass migrations, probably propelled by a population explosion, to seek new territory. Its migrations often appear to be prompted by weather, for instance, storms, falling temperatures, persistent winds, or prolonged rainfall.
==Life History==
Like all butterflies and moths - which belong to the advanced insects - the Black Witch has a ‘complete’ life cycle. Their life cycle starts with the adults mating. Then the female lays eggs. Caterpillars hatch from the eggs, feed voraciously, and spin cocoons. Adults emerge from the cocoons, prepared for a highly mobile life that will last no more than several weeks.

The Black Witch favors stands of woody legumes. The larvae, or caterpillars - striped and 2 1/2 to 3 inches in length - feed on the foliage of the legumes during the night and take refuge beneath bark during the day. Unlike some other moth larvae, they pose no threat to agricultural crops.

Like almost all moths, the adult Black Witch flies mostly at night, attracted to the nectar of flowers, the juices of fallen fruit or the sap of a legume. It rests during the day, oftentimes on the walls or under the eaves of entranceways, porches, garages.
===Life Hazards===
While the Black Witch is active primarily at night, with the darkness offering some protection, it sometimes falls prey to birds, for instance, the House Sparrow or the Loggerhead Shrike. It may become a meal for a bat or even an occasional meal for a spider.

Genus Actias which compromises of [[moon moths]]. The species was first described by Charles Oberthür in 1897. And reaches An adult moth's life is short, no longer than 10 to 12 days (females live longer due to the fact that the female sits still waiting for a mate). Pairing is easy in a medium-sized cage. A beautiful hybrid with ''Graellsia isabellae'' was obtained by a team of French entomologists

== Morphology ==
An incredibly large moon moth with different colorations depending on their genders, the adult males are a beautiful shade of lime yellow with a vibrant pink wing borders and a pair of yellow combed antennae and a large "Tail" like structure which of the same coloration of vibrant pink seen on the wing borders in males, the females are a beautiful shade of turquoise and teal with a similar shade of lime yellow tails. with a pair of short and straightened antennae the adults are gorgeous in their appearance with beautiful shades of their own and have widespread distribution in several parts of China The newly hatched larva is black with hairs. It sheds its skin four times in its larval stage. In the first instar, it is initially black but becomes a deep red brown as it grows. In the second instar, it continues to lighten to an orange brown. In the third instar it changes into beautiful green with white stripes and silver/gold metallic reflective markings on the sides of the tubercles.

== Life cycle ==
The female lays up to 120 eggs, and may place their eggs anywhere. The egg is oval-shaped, 1.5 × 1 mm; whitish gray, and firmly stuck to branches or sides of the cage that the female had been kept in. Caterpillars, 4–5 mm long, hatch after 10–14 days, the warmer and the higher the humidity, the quicker it happens. The newly hatched larva is black with hairs. It sheds its skin four times in its larval stage. In the first instar, it is initially black but becomes a deep red brown as it grows. In the second instar, it continues to lighten to an orange brown. In the third instar it changes into beautiful green with white stripes and silver/gold metallic reflective markings on the sides of the tubercles. Above the thoracic segments there is a stripe of white, black and red which can be opened and closed to show or hide the aposematic colouration. It is hairy in all its stages, and it feeds on pine trees. The fully grown caterpillar is 60–75 mm long. It spins its brownish silk cocoon on the ground among moss or among pine needles. They are easy to rear, as long as they eat in their first instar. The species comes from high mountainous regions, so it is quite cold hardy. It is best reared indoors, sleeved on a small pine tree. The chrysalis is about 35 mm long, and the imago emerges from the cocoon after about four weeks, depending on the temperature and humidity.

== Host plants ==

* Pine tree - ''Pinus'' species. 
* ''Pinus massoniana''. 
* ''Pinus sylvestris'' (Scots pine),
* ''nigra'' (black pine).

Danaus plexippus, (Formerly known as monarch) Is regarded as the most beautiful butterfly on this planet (Alongside being the most

Dione vanillae         .|image1=Daunaus plexippus.png|caption1=|title1=Monarch}}

food source is obtained from the milkweed plant making them venomous as an adult. Monarches have been known to do great and wondersome migrations in groups that contain innumerably great quantities of these beautiful butterflies. Also known as the the milkweed butterfly due to it's diet as a juvenile which primarily consists of nectar. 

== Appearance ==
They have a vibrant appearance, their bodies are black and have white spots on their bodies, their wings are a shade of vibrant vermillion with black intersecting lines on the fore wings and parallel ones at the hindwings, the borders of their wings are black and spotted with white polka-dots. The alignment of the venation-like patterns can help one differentiate between viceroy butterflies and Monarches as the wings of the viceroy butterflies have parallel lines on both hindwings and forewings that intersect with a single line at the near-end of their wings however viceroy butterflies look exactly similar to monarches on the underside of their wings, I will explain why as we proceed reading this article further. Anyway monarch butterflies can be seen in large swarms of upto 20 million individuals at once travelling from Canada to central America during the fall and looping the same migration annually, one of the most pretty sight in the world is to see the swarm resting idle on trees making them look (Almost) Completely vermillion in color.

== [[The great monarch butterfly migration|The migration]] ==
[[The great monarch butterfly migration|The great monarch migration]] is definitely something one can glare at for hours, these butterflies swarm up into huge clouds of butterflies and flutter from Canada to central America during fall and repeating the same process over and over in a cycle again and again. These butterflies will lay their eggs every generation as their maximum lifespan is only for 28 days and the minimum being 18 days. These swarms of fluttering wonders rest idle on trees and cover their leaves with their wings wide open and expanded making the entire forest look vermillion in color, it is a natural process as their caterpillars feed on milkweeds, there are many milkweed plants, plenty for all of the butterflies in total as milkweed is considered as a weed, monarches help in keeping the population of milkweeds under controlled. 

== Behaviors ==
[[File:Monarch Life cycle.png|thumb|Life cycle]]
As we said earlier, viceroy butterflies mimic Monarches this is because monarch butterflies are feared by several species of birds and other bigger predators due to the toxic chemical within their bodies they obtain as a larva by feeding off milkweed. The sap from the milkweed plants contain a notorious chemical which is highly venomous, Danous plexippus can digest such venom and use them for their own defense, birds that swallow monarch butterflies on accidents have been seen throwing up to save their lives Viceroy butterflies and other species of butterflies cannot afford consuming such venomous weeds like milkweed and therefore mimic monarch butterflies to avoid predators, monarch butterflies on the other hand have almost no predators due to this. If we talk about the common behaviour of Danous plexippus then the main point that comes into one's mind is that they are highly well socialized and migrate in large numbers. But that is NOT what makes them very special it is the fact that they always remember their way home, even a newly born generation remembers it's way from central America to Canada. Now most people may not know it but their brains despite being the size of a pinpoint carries this special genre  which helps them remember their way home each time they migrate. This is one of the main features that make them unique  from other [[Lepidoptera|lepidopterans.]]

== Distribution and Habitat ==
They prefer a wide range of tropical and sub-tropical regions occurring anywhere between central to north America. They prefer all kinds of forest ranging from deciduous to evergreen forests although native to north America they have a wide distribution in the northern temperate zone and love sunny-warm patches of grass covering meadows thriving with flowers and more importantly on a really necessary note, Monarches need milkweed plants in order to reproduce and for a new generation of butterflies to arise this is where they breed however the eastern distribution of butterflies ranged from Australia and some parts of Asia making them a greatly successful specimen.

exotic shimmering indigo color, their wings are tinted with a wide array of mesmerizing colors, unfortunately they are regarded as endangered and many thought they are now extinct however it is estimated there are more than 800 species alive however they are only seen on highly rare occasions due to their secretive habitats deep into the woodlands and lush-green forests, they are hardly ever seen in urban areas mainly due to habitat loss although fairly common.

== Morphology ==
The glittering mantle butterfly has an overwhelmingly beautiful appearance with mesmerizing shades of light green, olive green, indigo, and a wide array of similar colorations with their bodies being Prussian blue with bright green large compound eyes with a lustrous metallic shades occurring between blue to green and Green bordered edges and the center of their wings meeting at the [[thorax]] speckled with metallic green, they also have a pair of large [[Antenna|antennae]] which extend straight outwards being one of the key features to differentiate between lepidopterans (Butterflies and moths) their wingspan has an approximate length which is currently undetermined, a little or no information is available regarding their life cycles neither their is a physical description for the juvenile.

== Behavior ==
The adults spend most of their time perching on the canopy of vast rainforests and woodlands and are most likely to be discovered basking at low levelled foliage perching with their wings wide open over patches of weeds and moss as the green pigment on their wings conceals them while perching on batches of weeds and grass they prefer basking under sunshine near rivers and lakes while perching onto the pebbles near shallow streams of water. They are exceedingly elusive and seen only when they descend to immobile the water streams near freshwater and tropical canopy, they can also be seen sitting on edges of barks of trees creating a false notion to predators that they are nothing but moss crawling over the tree trunk and may occasionally get many by surprise by flying and making a quick escape upon realizing that  it's life under threat. A little of no information is available regarding their life  cycle or their habitual behaviors such as food for example.

[[Lime hawk-moth]]}}Laothoe populi, Also known as the '''Poplar Hawk-moth''', is a moth of the family [[Sphingidae]]. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus

in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It is found throughout the Palearctic region and the Near East and is one of the most common members of the family in the region. It is distinctive due to its habit of resting with its hindwings held further forward than (but still half hidden by) the forewings.
== Morphology ==
[[File:Laothoe populi Moth (2).png|thumb|247x247px|A camouflaged female]]
Laothoe populi is certainly one of the more cunning species of hawkmoths with a strikingly close appearance to a deaf leaf as they bask under the sunlight over a tree branch, their wings have blotched wings that create a notion of the specimen being a dead leaf. They have slightly pale venations on their wings that are almost completely parallel to one another. Their coloration is typically a mix between different shades of dull brown. The wings of female specimen seem to have tiny white spots on their wings with a larger scarlet blotch on the hindwing. These moths have large bodies with curved, hairless antennae that are mostly white and extremely thin and minute in terms of size and only has a singular segment. Their wings have a curved, downward facing set of forewings. The males have a light yellow tinted wings with shades of dull brown and the red blotches are also present in males, the males have a vibrant yellow shade closely similar to mornem flavescens. The eggs are silver-grey and look like pearls, the larva is green in color, with vibrant shades of pastel and bright green and soon it's coloration wanes away as it molts.

== Life cycle ==
[[File:Laothoe populi moth larvae.jpg|thumb|A baby poplar hawk-moth larva.]]
Adults are on the wing and looking for mates between '''May and August'''. Females release pheromones which attract passing males and lay their eggs beneath leaves. Caterpillars hatch and feed between June and early October. They eventually descend to the ground to pupate and overwinter beneath the surface.

&lt;span lang="ga" dir="ltr"&gt;Eugenius Johann Christoph Esper described the striped hawk-moth in 1780 using a specimen found in Italy at Livorno (hence the Latin name ''livornica''). In 1819 Jacob Hübner allocated this species in his newly erected genus ''Hyles''.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span lang="ga" dir="ltr"&gt;Until the 20th century ''Hyles livornica'' has been considered conspecific with the American ''Hyles lineata'' and is therefore under that name (or as ''Celerio lineata'' ssp.

''Hyles renneri'' from Nepal is sometimes treated as a valid species.&lt;/span&gt;

==&lt;span lang="ga" dir="ltr"&gt;Morphology&lt;/span&gt;==
&lt;span lang="ga" dir="ltr"&gt;''Hyles livornica'' has a wingspan reaching 60–80 mm. Males are slightly smaller than females. The forewings and the body are mainly olive brown or beige, with white stripes. brown forewings wings and Cream colored venation with paler white marking on the thoracic region alongside a striped abdomen The hindwings are pink, with black and white edges. The head and the thorax are olive-brown, with white stripes. The olive-brown abdomen has black-and-white segment, the first two segments have large black and white side spots. The antennae are dark olive brown and have a white tip. These moths fly from February to October depending on the location. In Europe they are visible from April to June and from August to September in two generations and sometimes they overwinter. This species is a migrant from Africa to Europe. The caterpillars are green, with black markings and reach a length from 65 to 80 millimeters.&lt;/span&gt;

The hummingbird hawk-moth is a species of hawk moth found across temperate regions of Eurasia. The species is named for its similarity to hummingbirds, as they feed on the nectar of tube-shaped flowers using their long proboscis while hovering in the air; this resemblance is an example of convergent evolution.

The Luna moth is a Nearctic moth in the family [[Saturniidae]], subfamily [[Saturniinae]], a group commonly known as giant silk moths. The moths

must wait for the wings to dry and harden before being able to fly. This process can take 2–3 hours to complete. Luna moths are not rare, but are rarely seen due to their very brief (7–10 day) adult lives and nocturnal flying time. As with all giant silk moths, the adults only have vestigial mouthparts and no digestive system and therefore do not eat in their adult form, instead relying on energy they stored up as caterpillars. In regions where there are two or three generations per year, the second and third may have wing coloration that is more of a yellow-green compared to the first generation of the year!

== Taxonomy ==
escribed and named ''Phalena plumata caudata'' by James Petiver in 1700, this was the first North American saturniid to be reported in the insect literature. The initial Latin name, which roughly translates to "brilliant, feather tail", was replaced when Carl Linnaeus described the species in 1758 in the tenth edition of Systema Naturae, and renamed it ''Phalaena luna'', later ''Actias luna'', with ''luna'' derived from Luna, the Roman moon goddess. The common name became "Luna moth". Several other North American giant silk moths were also given species names after Roman or Greek mythology.

== Morphology ==
eggs, attached in small groups to undersides of leaves, are mottled white and brown, slightly oval, and roughly 1.5 millimeters in diameter. Larvae are primarily green, with sparse hairs. The first instar, emerging from the egg, reaches a length of 6–8 mm (0.24–0.31 in), the second 9–10 mm (0.35–0.39 in), the third 12–16 mm (0.47–0.63 in) and the fourth 23–26 mm (0.91–1.02 in). The fifth (final) instar grows to approximately 70–90 mm (2.8–3.5 in) in length. Small, colorful dots – yellow or magenta – may line the sides of the fourth and fifth instars. The larvae may take on a reddish-brown color just prior to cocooning. Fifth-instar larvae descend to the ground and use silk to bind dead leaves around the cocoon. The imagoes (winged and mature), often referred to as 'adult moths,' emerge from the pupae with the wings small, crumpled and held close to the body. Over a period of several hours the wings will enlarge to full size. Wingspan is typically 8–11.5 cm (3.1–4.5 in), and in rare instances as much as 17.78 cm (7.00 in). Females and males are similar in size and appearance: green wings, eyespots on both forewings and hind wings, and long, sometimes somewhat twisted tails extending from the back edge of the hindwings. Bodies are white and hairy. Adults have vestigial mouthparts and do not feed. Energy is from fat stores created while a caterpillar. The forward edge of the forewing is dark-colored and thick, tapering in thickness from the thorax to the wing tip. Its color can range from maroon to brown. The eyespots, one per wing, are oval in shape on the forewings and round on the hindwings. Each eyespot can have arcs of black, blue, red, yellow, green or white. The eyespots are thought to confuse potential predators. There are some gender-determined and regional differences in appearance. Females will have a larger abdomen compared to males because it contains 200–400 eggs. Both sexes have antennae, but on the male, much longer and wider. Wing color is blue-green in the north and for the over-wintering generation in the central and southern states; second and third generation wing color has more of a yellow-green tint.

== Life cycle ==
[[File:Luna moth.jpg|thumb|281x281px]]
Based on the climate in which they live, Luna moths produce different numbers of generations per year. In Canada and northern regions of the United States they are univoltine, meaning one generation per year. Life stages are approximately 10 days as eggs, 6–7 weeks as larvae, 2-3 weeks as pupae, finishing with one week as winged adults appearing in late May or early June. In the mid-Atlantic states the species is bivoltine, and farther south trivoltine, meaning respectively two and three generations per year. In the central states the first generation appears in April, second in July. Even farther south, first generation appears as early as March, with second and third spaced eight to ten weeks later. Females lay 200–400 eggs, singly or in small groups, on the underside of leaves of the tree species preferred by the larvae. Egg laying starts the evening after mating is completed and goes on for several days. Eggs hatch in about a week. Each instar – the period between molts – generally takes about 4–10 days. There are five instars before cocooning. At the end of each instar, a small amount of silk is placed on the major vein of a leaf and the larva undergoes apolysis, then ecdysis (molting), leaving the old exoskeleton behind. Sometimes the shed exoskeleton is eaten. Each instar is green, though the first two instars do have some variation in which some larvae will have black underlying splotches on their dorsal side. The final instar grows to approximately 70 mm (2.8 in) to 90 mm (3.5 in) in length. This is a tree-dwelling species. Larvae stay on the same tree where they hatched until it is time to descend to the ground to make a cocoon. When females emerge from cocoons they fly to preferred tree species, emit pheromones, and wait there for males to find them. The Luna moth pupates after spinning a silk cocoon, which is thin and single layered. Shortly before pupation, the final, fifth-instar caterpillar will engage in a "gut dump" where any excess water and intestinal contents are expelled. As pupae, this species is more physically active than most moths. When disturbed, the moths will wiggle within their pupal cases, producing a noise. Pupation takes approximately two weeks unless the individual is in diapause over winter, in which case the pupal stage takes about nine months. The mechanisms triggering diapause are generally a mixture of genetic triggers, duration of sunlight and temperature. The pupae have chitinous spurs near the base of the forewings. By vigorously moving about within the cocoon, these spurs tear a circular opening from which the imago emerges, the silk of the cocoon having also been weakened by the secretion of cocoonase, a protein-digesting enzyme.

== Distribution ==
Distribution. The Luna moth is found in '''North America''', from east of the Great Plains in the United States – Florida to Maine, and from Saskatchewan eastward through central Quebec to Nova Scotia in Canada. Luna moths are also rarely found in Western Europe as vagrants.

'''''Automeris IO''''', the '''IO moth''', is a colorful North American moth in the family Saturniidae. The Io (''EYE-oh'') moth ranges from the southeast corner of Manitoba and in the southern extremes of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in Canada, and in the US it is found from Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, east of those states and down to the southern end of Florida. The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775.

Higher classification: Automeris

Family: [[Saturniidae]]

Order: [[Lepidoptera]]

== Appearance ==
A large moth  with a wingspan of 2.5–3.5 inches (63–88 mm), this species have differences among both genders with the females having dark-brown colored wings and the hind wings possessing a pair of eye spots used to threaten predators by reveling them as a method of astonishing their predators. The males have their wings painted with bright yellow, vermillion and brown delicate scales alongside having Indigo painted eye spots with a Dark outlined hindwing. The female's dark brown scales blend them in perfectly within their sorroundings concealing them from potential predators.

== Life cycle ==
The eggs have large micropyle rosettes that turn black as the fertile eggs develop. They are usually laid in clusters of more than twenty. From the eggs, orange larvae emerge, usually eating their egg shell soon after hatching. They go through five instars, each one being a little different. The caterpillars are gregarious in all their instars, many times traveling in single file processions all over the food plant. As the larvae develop, they will lose their orange color and will turn bright green and urticating, having many spines. These stinging spines have a very painful venom that is released with the slightest touch; a condition known as erucism. The green caterpillars have two lateral stripes, the upper one being bright red and the lower one being white. When the caterpillars are ready, they spin a flimsy, valveless cocoon made from a dark, coarse silk. Some larvae will crawl to the base of the tree and make their cocoons among leaf litter on the ground, while others will use living leaves to wrap their cocoons with. The leaves will turn brown and fall to the ground during autumn, taking the cocoons with them. There they pupate, the pupa being dark brown/black. The pupae of the females are considerably larger than those of the males.

Adult moths normally emerge from their cocoons in late morning or early afternoon. Eclosion (emergence from the cocoon) only takes a few minutes. After eclosing, the moths climb and hang on plants so that their furled wings can be inflated with fluid (hemolymph) pumped from the body. This inflation process takes about twenty minutes.

Adult moths are strictly nocturnal, flying generally only during the first few hours of the night. The females generally wait until nightfall and then extend a scent gland from the posterior region of the abdomen, in order attract males via wind-borne pheromones. The males use their much bigger antennae to track down the females. After mating, the females lay eggs then wait to die. These moths, like all moths in the family Saturniidae, have vestigial mouthparts and do not eat in the adult stage.

== Poison level ==

in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Atlas moths are named after Atlas, the Titan of Greek mythology (due to their size). In Hong Kong, the Cantonese means "snake's head moth", referring to the prominent extension of the forewing which bears resemblance to the head of a snake.

== Morphology ==
The Atlas moth is one of the largest lepidopterans, with a wingspan measuring up to 24 cm (9.4 in) and a wing surface area of about 160 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (~25 in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It is only surpassed in wingspan by the white witch (''Thysania agrippina'') and ''Attacus caesar'', and in wing surface area by the Hercules moth (''Coscinocera hercules''). As in most Lepidoptera, females are noticeably larger and heavier than males, while males have broader antennae.

The body is disproportionately small compared to the wings. The upperside of the wings are reddish brown with a pattern of black, white, pink, and purple lines and triangular, scale-less windows bordered in black. The undersides of the wings are paler. Both forewings have a prominent extension at the tip, with markings that resemble the head of a snake, a resemblance which is exaggerated by movements of the wings when the moth is confronted by potential predators.

The Atlas moth has a very short, vestigial proboscis, and they do not eat once they have emerged from the cocoon, relying on fat storage for energy. Every flight takes valuable energy and can take days off their already short lives, as it has a very short life span of only one to two weeks. They conserve energy by flying as little as possible. A female will wait for a male to come along and be fertilised, lay eggs and die.

== The time to see atlas moths ==
The Atlas Moth is nocturnal in nature, and pops out in the '''evening and nighttime hours between 7 p.m. and 4 a.m.''' in your time zone. If your island is in the Northern Hemisphere, this variety of moth will be around from April until the end of September.

== Region ==
[[File:Atlas moth caterpillar.jpg|thumb|The larva of atlas moths.]]
One of the largest moth species in the world, the atlas moth (Attacus atlas), is found '''throughout Asia''' and is widespread in China, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, and Taiwan and even Indonesia. Their habitat is primarily dry tropical forests, secondary forests, and shrublands across Asia, including Borneo, though one specimen, an adult female, was found in 2012 in Ramsbottom, England after it landed on a windowsill, and presumed to have escaped from a private collection

{{Insects_Simple|image1=Orange oakleaf.png|caption1=Underside of wings|order=Lepidoptera|family=Nymphalidae|genus=Kallima|species=K. inachus|similar_species=Large tree nymph 
Kallima paralecta}}

from the family of Nymphalidae from the genus ''Kallima.'' One of the insects with a remarkably excellent mimicry.

== Morphology ==
The underside of the wings of the Indian oakleaf butterfly has strikingly similar and deceiving appearance of a dead oak tree leaf with parallel venations and a brown-dull coloration with a dark brown venations present on the underside of wings to fool unsuspecting predators, they can be seen basking on the forest floor at a low-foliage level with slightly dense foliage or clinging onto branches of trees, they are likely to be seen during the ''Autumnal equinox'' (around 20 March and 23 September) As they acknowledge their camouflage ability to fade into the foliage without being noticed by any predators upon obtaining any opportunity to escape, this cunning butterfly will utilize it. The upper side of wings of the wings when open wide out are bright indigo and blue with a broad orange stripe on the forewings with a streak of Prussian blue. The wingspan of the butterfly ranges from 85 to 110 millimeters. The name is derived from their broad orangish vermillion stripe, the appearance of their hindwings and the fact they are native to South-East Asia especially India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. 

== Behavior ==
[[File:Orange oakleaf camouflage.png|thumb|254x254px]]
They acknowledge their own cryptid colorations and know how to utilize their ability by clinging onto branches and basking on low foliage, creating a false notion to predators, upon being provided with any opportunities to escape, the Orange oakleaf will do it's best, to counter it's predator with a quick response and charging into the air upon realizing the threat it has gone into. Their upper wings are used to shock their predators with a glare of vibrant blue and orange wings to surprise it's predators by getting them by surprise shocking them.

== Habitat ==
Orange oakleaves are normally seen basking over low foliage or clinging onto tree branches, these butterflies excel at mimicry and are hard to be spotted by an "Ordinary vision" they have a wide distribution in south-east Asian countries especially India, Pakistan (Recorded living in 2000) and Afghanistan Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, down to Tenasserim Hills. In Southeast Asia it occurs in southern China, Thailand, Laos, Taiwan, and Vietnam found in tropical regions, they prefer woodlands, semi-arid region or a lush canopy free from predators and thriving with pollen-rich flowers.

== Metamorphosis ==
Eggs are laid in batches over oakleaves the larva start out yellowish-lime in color as they continue to consume more food, it will develop a more pastel green color as it grows the yellow colors on it's soft body will start fading away, eventually they develop hard pointed structures on their backs that are broad, large and pointed and black in color, the caterpillar's skin keeps becoming darker eventually become darker and their pointed spikes becoming bright orange, and can deliver a painful venom if the caterpillar has been disturbed. Then it will pupate by suspending itself under a tree branch, the pupa has a rough, bumpy feel with mall spikes poking out of it as a protective mechanism, the chrysalis is an irregular pattern of brown colors that looks like a dead leaf hanging from the tree branches.

[[Otosema odora]]
[[Phalaena Bombyx odorata]]}}The erebid moth Ascalapha odorata, commonly known as the black witch, is a large bat-shaped, dark-colored nocturnal moth, ranging from the southern United States to Brazil. It is the largest noctuoid in the continental United States.

== Morphology ==
Female moths can attain a wingspan of 24 cm. The dorsal surfaces of their wings are mottled brown with hints of iridescent purple and pink, and, in females, crossed by a white bar. The diagnostic marking is a small spot on each forewing shaped like a number nine or a comma. This spot is often green with orange highlights. Males are somewhat smaller, reaching 12 cm in width, darker in color and lacking the white bar crossing the wings. The larva is a large caterpillar up to 7 cm in length with intricate patterns of black and greenish-brown spots and stripes.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Diet ==
Black Witch Moths caterpillars eat '''legumes''', and favor acacia and mesquite. They are perfectly harmless, not an agricultural pest, and have no teeth or stingers. The folklore surrounding Black Witch Moth, like the moth itself, is all over the map.

{{Insects_Simple|title1=Thysania agrippina|image1=White witch moth.jpg|caption1=The largest known lepidopteran|order=Lepidoptera|family=[[Erebidae]]|genus=[[Thysania]]|species=T. agrippina|similar_species=[[Ascalapha odorata]]}}

The most commonly accepted English name is the white witch. Other common names include the '''ghost moth''', '''great grey witch''' and '''great owlet moth'''. The idea of the name "White witch" comes from the fact that entomologist were not able to collect any specimen using bullets in the medieval era!

== Morphology ==
With a gorgeous wingspan of 30 cm (16 Inches) Thysania agrppina is certainly the largest known lepidopterans, With the underside of the wings being darkened and painted in shades of brown with distinctive pale white markings forming an admirable tessellations on the wings of the white witch moth, the upper wings are painted with pale white colors with a similar tessellation as for the underside of the delicate scale-covered wings, the wings moth appears to have a tendency for dull colors concealing it amongst it's surrounding while perching on tree branches, these large lepidopterans are potentially invisible to predators.
&lt;br /&gt;

== Region ==
The white witch flies '''over most of the New World tropics, from Argentina to Mexico, and occasionally as far north as Colorado in the United States'''. You would suppose that scientists must know the story of such an impressive organism. We don't have much information regarding the metamorphosis of the species currently.

== Morphology ==
[[Adult|Adults]] have a wingspan of about 27 centimetres (11 in), making it the largest moth found in Australia, and its wings have the largest documented surface area (300 square centimeters) of any living insect (Other than ''[[White Witch moth|Thysania agrippina]])'' . They are mainly colored golden-brown and white, with transparent spots on each of the four wing sections – the coloring and patterns between genders is mostly static. However, adult males have longer, slimmer tails on their wings than females do, making it somewhat easy to differentiate them in this way.

Their larvae grow up to 12 cm (about 4.7 in), and will weigh around 29 grams in their final instar.  They are a pale-blue or green color, with red dots along their sides and yellow spines.

Bombyx mori is also known as the domestic silk moth or the mulberry worm is a species of the order [[Lepidoptera]] from the family of [[Bombicidae]] from the genus 

{{Insects_Simple|image1=Bombyx mori.png|caption1=A fluffy, cute white moth|order=Lepidoptera|family=Bombycidae|genus=Bombyx|species=B.mori|similar_species=Bombyx Mandarina}}

[[Bombyx]]. Their larva are primarily responsible for the production of silk and is therefore known as [[silkworm]] the process of extraction of silk from their [[Pupa|cocoons]] is known as [[Sericulture]].Silk moths have a wingspan of 3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in)

== Morphology ==
Bombyx mori has a fluffy-hair fringed body and small silver-veined wings they also posses a pair of hair-fringed comb-like [[Antenna|antennae]]. Their antennae are one of the key features used to describe them. The color of their bodies and wings is pure milky white color other than their antenna and eyes.  it spread to India, Korea, Nepal, Japan, and the West. The domestic silk moth was domesticated from the wild silk moth ''Bombyx mandarina'', which has a range from northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia. The domestic silk moth derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock. the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China, It is an economically important insect, being a primary producer of silk. A silkworm's preferred food are white mulberry leaves, though they may eat other mulberry species and even the orange. Domestic silk moths are entirely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding. Wild silk moths (other species of ''Bombyx'') are not as commercially viable in the production of textile.

== Metamorphosis ==
Eggs take about an approximate of 13 days (Almost 2 weeks) to hatch into silkworm, that have a constant habit of feeding continuously. They have a high preference for mulberry, As their second name suggests that is, the mulberry worm. However they aren't monophagous (Prefer only one kind of food) since they can eat other species of mulberries, as well as some other wild berry bushes, mostly oranges. . When the color of their heads eventually becomes darker, it is an indication that they have outgrown their own bodies. After molting, the larval phase of the silkworms emerge as a white worm. After they have molted four to five times, their bodies become slightly tinted with a light shade of yellow. The larvae then cling onto a surface ready to enter their secondary pupal stage (Semi-adult) , and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of the silk produced by the silk glands of the caterpillar. The final molt from larva to pupa takes place inside the cocoon, which provides a vital layer of protection to the vulnerable pupal stage preventing it from being exposed to the dangerous world full of hungry predators. Many other Lepidopterans produce cocoons namely moths however only Bombyx mori and Bombyx mandarina and a few notable other species carry out the entire process using fabrics and textile materials. If the animal is allowed to survive after spinning its cocoon and through the pupal phase of its lifecycle, it releases a highly corrosive enzymes... enzymes to penetrate through the cocoon by creating a hole inside it in the cocoon so it can emerge as an adult Bombyx mori. The corrosive enzymes are only corrosive to the silk which decreases the value of the silk greatly therefore silkworms are boiled and killed in some countries where Sericulture is carried out, the silkworms upon being destroyed are killed.

the adult phase of the lifecycle in which unfortunately is not capable of a purely well functioning flight, in a comparative degree to the wild ''B. mandarina'' and other ''Bombyx'' species, whose males fly to meet females and for evasion from predators. Some may emerge with the ability to lift off and stay airborne, but sustained flight cannot be achieved. This is because their bodies are too big and heavy for their small wings. Females are about two to three times bulkier and heavier than males as they are carrying the eggs but have similarl colorations. Adult Bombycidae have reduced and un-developed [[Proboscis|mouthparts]] and do not feed like several moth species.

== Sericulture ==
he cocoon is made of a thread of raw silk from 300 to about 900 m (1,000 to 3,000 ft) long. The fibers are very fine and lustrous, about 10 μm (0.0004 in) in diameter. About 2,000 to 3,000 cocoons are required to make 1 pound of silk (0.4 kg). At least 70 million pounds (32 million kg) of raw silk are produced each year, requiring nearly 10 billion cocoons. The domestic species ''B. mori'', compared to the wild species (e.g., ''B. mandarina''), has increased cocoon size, body size, growth rate, and efficiency of its digestion. It has gained tolerance to human presence and handling, and also to living in crowded conditions. The domestic silk moths cannot fly, so the males need human assistance in finding a mate, and it lacks fear of potential predators. The native color pigments have also been lost, so the domestic silk moths are leucitic, since camouflage is not useful when they only live in captivity. These changes have made ''B. mori'' entirely dependent upon humans for survival, and it does not exist in the wild. The eggs are kept in incubators to aid in their hatching. Silkworms were first domesticated in China over 5,000 years ago. Since then, the silk production capacity of the species has increased nearly tenfold. The silkworm is one of the few organisms wherein the principles of genetics and breeding were applied to harvest maximum output. It is second only to maize in exploiting the principles of heterosis and crossbreeding. Silkworm breeding is aimed at the overall improvement of silkworms from a commercial point of view. The major objectives are improving fecundity (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better pupation rate, fewer dead larvae in the montage, shorter larval duration (this lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced are directly related to the pupation rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors, including genetics.

== Trivia ==
Bombyx mori is one of the few species interdependent on humans for their survival as they are unable to fly due to their fluffy bodies and are defenseless against common predators.

{{More_detailed_infobox|image1=Daphnis nerii.png|common_name=Oleander Hawkmoth|order=Lepidoptera|diet=Young: Leaves of the Oleander Plant

Adult: Nectar from flowes|activity=Nocturnal}}

== Daphnis nerii ==
Daphnis nerii, also known as the Oleander hawkmoth Belongs to the [[Sphingidae]] family, they are spectacularly mesmerizing artworks of nature. They can be seen throughout Europe during summer season and can be seen all year around in eastern and western Africa and south east Asia. The first person to describe this species of Sphingidae was Carl Linnaeus in 1758.

== Morphology ==
Regarded as one of the truly spectacular and mesmerizing artworks by the nature, the oleander hawkmoth's wings are a combination of several vibrant shades of green ranging from olive to pale green, their wings are painted with abstract and unusual  patterns The amazing shades of green keep them concealed within their surrounding and makes them remarkably distinctive in color at the same time. These moths also posses white, pale green, olive green and a streak of light-pink color there bodies are banded with the same shades of enviable green with olive and dark green. Oleander hawkmoth caterpillar upon reaching full maturity are green with an electric-blue stripe on it's body and speckled with teal spots they have two distinctive eye-like marking on their forehead that are electric blue, an entirely matured oleander hawk-moth larvae measure around 7.5 to 8.5 cm in length (Upon reaching full maturity) and feed on a great variety of highly toxic (And some non-toxic) Plants the caterpillars have a rear horn-like structure at the ends of their bodies throughout their entire lives that is, upon reaching full maturity, they also gain a great distribution ranging from Europe to Asian and even some certain parts of Hawaiian Islands. it is a migratory species, flying to parts of eastern and southern Europe during the summer season in search of food, habitat and suitable climatic conditions, particularly in Turkey.[[File:Daphnis nerii.png|thumb|4x4px|alt=]]
== Food Habits ==
[[File:Oleander hawkmoth lifecycle.png|thumb|258x258px|Life cycle of Daphnis nerii]]
The adult Daphnis nerii feed on a variety of flowering plants their availability is the major concern therefore we have plenty of information regarding their food habits.  The adults feed on nectar of a great variety of flowers. They love flowers with a sweet-smelling nectar like petunia, night-flowering jasmine honeysuckle, periwinkles, oleander and many others. They are especially active during the late evening and the twilight hours, fluttering over the flowers once the sun sets and dusk falls. The caterpillars feed mainly on periwinkle and oleander leaves, oleander is highly toxic flowering shrub also kept as a common garden plant, The caterpillars have a natural invulnerability against the toxins of the oleander plant. They also may feed on many other flowering plants of the dogbane plant family (A term used for taxonomy of plants in botany), such as Arabian penesula flowers'','' night-flowering jasmine plant and many other plants native in India. They also eat the buds and the sepals flowers of a few flowering plants at night.

== Distribution ==
Ranging from several parts of Africa to the entire Europe during summers and in south-east Asia all year around, this migratory hawkmoth is not as common as one may expect ranging from several parts Of east, west and North Africa all year around and south-East Asia all year around seen in Several parts of India, Iran, Iraq and '''Especially''' turkey these large winged hawkmoths can be seen only in summers throughout the entire Europe But has a wider distribution in southern Europe.

perfect example of Batesian mimicry continue to read in order to understand the cunning nature of this beautiful species of butterfly. The viceroy's wingspan is between 53 and 81 mm (2.1 and 3.2 in). It can be distinguished from the monarch by its smaller size

== Morphology ==

=== Mullerian mimicry ===
Whenever it comes to Batesian mimicry, Limentis archippus surely does excel at mimicking the highly venomous Danaus plexippus at an astonishingly great accuracy. Similar to Danaus plexippus, The viceroy butterfly is coated beautifully with vermillion scales and have the same parallel black venations, unlike Danaus plexippus, Limentis Archippus do not have a dense border line at the edge of their brilliant wings infact the wing borders are much thinner and are not speckled with whitish-yellow spots, instead their borderlines of the wings have aligned spots. They have a line that intersects all the others at the hindwing and the forewings unlike Danaus plexippus neither are their bodies speckled with colorful scales, the wings have a sharp and bumpy edge unlike the smooth edged of Danaus plexippus. The caterpillars astonishingly have also learnt the use of Mullerian mimicry to avoid being consumed, They have antennae on their rear as well as their heads unlike Danaus plexippus, the larva are much lighter in color with their bodies being a mixture of pale yellow, lime and the feelers being maroon instead of being matt-black. When avian predators were exposed to butterfly abdomens without the wings, many avian predators rejected the viceroy after a single peck. Furthermore, they exhibited distress behavior similar to that displayed when eating other, known, unpalatable species.

==== Evolution ====
Based on phylogenic evidence, it is known that mimicry in the North American admirals was a driver of speciation. An essential condition for the evolution of mimicry was the presence and abundance of unpalatable models. Mimetic evolution also involved direct selection with the model acting as a "starting block" for the mimic to evolve against. The drive behind this type of evolution must be predation. Eventually, the mimetic population undergoes phenotypic fixation, usually at a point where the wing pattern and colors of the mimic have reached the closest superficial resemblance of its model. As these processes continued, the subspecies divergences began occurring as the mimetic species expanded their geographical range and began mimicking other species of butterfly.

Lonomia obliqua, the giant silkworm moth, is a species of saturniid moth from South 

America. It is famous for its larval form, rather than the

adult moth, primarily because of the caterpillar's defense mechanism, urticating bristles that inject a potentially deadly venom

== Morphology ==
These caterpillars are about 4.5 to 5.5 centimeters (about 2 in) long, with background colors ranging from green to brown. Well camouflaged, they have rows of tubercles crowned with whorls of easily detachable spines of different sizes.

== Behavior ==

=== Defense mechanism ===
[[File:Killer catterpillar.jpg|thumb|248x248px|Caterpillar]]
Caterpillars of many species can cause irritation by their hollow body hairs that envenom or detach easily, or can be poisonous if ingested; however, prior to investigations into ''Lonomia'' caterpillars, it was not known that caterpillars could produce toxins which in sufficient quantities could kill a human being. ''Lonomia obliqua'' is found in the south of Brazil in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Paraná. The species appears to be spreading to the southeast of Brazil, and recent accidents with the species were reported in the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais. ''Lonomia obliqua'' is also found in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina.

== Toxicology ==
It was discovered that the toxin in the caterpillar's skin held potent anti-clotting agents. This anti-clotting agent would attach to another protein of the body's cells and cause them to leak as blood is unable to clot. This internal bleeding would fill the surrounding tissue with "bruised blood". This internal bleeding spreads through the internal organs and eventually leads to compression and brain death.

== Symptoms ==
The early symptoms include rashes, burning pain, itching followed by nausea and mild fever that increases over time. More severe symptoms include respiratory problems, difficulties with breathing, delayed clotting of blood, tissue death, organ failure which ultimately results in death of the victim worst of all, there is no known cure nor there is any antidote till this date. '''The only known treatment to a Lonomia obliqua sting is antifibrinolytics'''.

It is found in Northeast India, the Western Ghats and parts of Southeast Asia. The butterfly was reassigned to genus ''[[Burara]]'' by Vane-Wright and de Jong (2003) and is considered by them to be ''Burara gomata''. The common green Awlet can now be seen as a mascot for the [[Insect Wiki]]! 

== Morphology ==
Both genders among this species of butterfly have a wingspan of 50 to 55 mm.  Upperside pale vinaceous brown; both wings with pale brownish yellow streaks longitudinally between the veins. [[Abdomen]] blackish brown with yellowish bands. Cilia yellowish. Underside dark brown, with the veins and longitudinal streaks between them greyish green, the brown showing only along each side of the veins; posterior margin of forewing broadly pale vinaceous; exterior margin of both wings defined by a brown line. Third joint of [[Insect terminology|palpi]] and edge of sides brown, the rest yellow. Thorax, legs and abdomen beneath orange yellow. The females Expanse 2.3 inches. Upperside of the wings are very dark glossy bronzy and green, shading off into glossy indigo-blue at the apex and outer margin. Underside with the markings and ground-colour darker than in Sikkim males; forewing with a pale green spot in the second median interspace, with a larger one in the interspace below it, in the male these spots are merged in a large patch of the ochreous ground-colour from the inner margin. The green markings everywhere more restricted and of a darker shade than in the male.

== Region ==
[[File:Bibas gomata.jpg|thumb|283x283px]]
The pale green awlet ranges from India, Myanmar, the Malay Peninsula, the Philippines, and the Indonesian archipelago. In India, the butterfly is found in South India up to North Kanara, and along the Himalayas from Sikkim to Assam and eastwards to Myanmar. The type locality is Darjeeling in the north of West Bengal. This species is rare in South India but fairly common in the Himalayas.

== Trivia ==

* Burara Gomata was the chosen mascot for the insect Wiki with the other two mascots being '''Vanessa atalanta''' and '''Aglais IO.''' Coincedentally, both species including Burara Gomata can also be found in India.

''Hyphantria cunea'' also known as '''Fall Webworm''' is a species from the family [[Erebidae]] native to North America. It was first described by Dru Drury in 1773.

== Morphology ==

=== Wing Morphology ===
''Hyphantria cunea'' have an adult wingspan of 30 mm at an average. They have thick fluffy bodies with a light tint of yellow, The females have pale white translucent wings painted with glistening tinted golden scales. The males have forewings densely speckled with white marks, The abdomen is fuzzy densely coated with pale setae.

=== Larval Morphology ===
The larvae are pale white and have bodies coated densely in pale-white setae modified as venomous spikes, some setae serve as decoy spikes to make them look specially dangerous. The legs have small black blotches that lie adjacent to each other. The larvae occur in a versatile diversity of colors, ranging from pale yellow, white, dark\chocolate brown etc.

== Behavior ==

=== Defense ===
Though adults are mostly defenseless, The larvae are coated densely in setae modified as venomous spikes making it a hazard to other larger predators, The venomous spikes, once embedded onto the external parts of any attacker cause an irritant rash and may lead to the formation of bristles, the venom causes a long-duration itch and rashes, The attackers are often brutally countered with such hazardous defenses of ''Hyphantria cunea.''

==== Sting Treatment ====
Use Duck tape to gently remove any stingers before washing the wound thoroughly in order to prevent the venom from spreading, Apply Ice to the wound and visit the doctor ASAP. 

== Metamorphosis ==

=== Egg ===
[[File:Fall Webworm (1).jpg|thumb|192x192px|Larvae]]
The eggs are laid on the leaves of the host plants the eggs are laid in clusters of hundreds if not thousands.

=== Larval stage ===
The larval instar occurs after one or two weeks, the larvae are gregarious and gluttonous eaters and can defoliate trees withing a short duration of time and mostly continue to eat as they await their next instar. The larvae create enormous tents out of their silk and form a form of "Shelter" to defend against predators, the silk is sticky and they form large tent-like structures supported by a network of branches in which they pupate.

=== Pupal Instar ===
The larvae spend the harsh winters in the pupal instar, the pupa is made up of silk with a small layer of silk shielding the cocoon inside the pupae.

=== Adult (Imago) ===
The adults emerge during spring and early summers to find a soulmate and reproduce.

== Ecology ==

=== Host Plants ===

* Carya illinoinensis
* Ulmus americana
* Salix Species
* Arbutus menziesii 
* Platanus occidentalis
* Betula platyphylla

The ventral side of the wings have a matt-black background and a smooth borderline, The forewings are densely speckled with iridescent marks, two Dashes of vibrant, lustrous metallic-blue color are present on the hindwings. The wings are charmingly tiny and vivid, This is surely one of the most remarkable and brilliant Amazonian species of Lepidoptera.

=== Body Morphology ===
The abdomens have 4 sparkling latitudinal lines of metallic-blue coloration, the body is thick and has a brown thoracic region speckled with sparkling blue patches, the head compromises of two gunmetal colored bulging eyes and hooked antennae.

== Behavior ==
Sostrata Festiva generally keep their wings extent outwards which is a unique behavior for a Papillion and is generally typical among moths.  They tend to typical stay solo, males can often be seen basking above ground-level on lowland foliage.

== Geographical Range ==

=== Geographical Distribution ===
Sostrata festiva is known from Guyana, Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru, but probably also occurs in Colombia, Bolivia and Argentina.

=== Habitat ===
S. Festiva prefers to thrive in lush steep and densely foliated tropical rainforests, sunny large patches of grass blossoming with flowers. They prefer to flutter in steep groves and forests as well.

== Amplypterus panopus ==
'''Amplypterus panopus''', or the '''Mango Hawkmoth''', is a Lepidopteran that is found in tropical forests and some urban areas from Sri Lanka to the Phillipines. It belongs to the family [[Sphingidae]], which is the family for Hawkmoths.

This moth as two subspecies, ''Amplypterus panopus panopus'' and ''Amplypterus panopus hainanensis'' (found in Hainan only).

== Distribution ==
The Mango Hawkmoth is found in Sri Lanka, southern and northern India (including the Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands), Nepal, Myanmar, southern China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia (to Sulawesi) and the Philippines. Although widespread, they are sometimes rarely seen in some parts of their range (e.g. Singapore) due to them being high up in the canopy and constantly overlooked.

== Morphology ==
This medium to large sized moth is superficially similar to ''[[Adhemarius dariensis]]''. ''A. Panopus'' has a 130–168 mm (13-16.8cm) wingspan and body structure like other hawkmoths of its genus. Head, thorax, and terminal segments of abdomen golden brown; the proximal segments pale. Fore wing purplish flesh-colour (that's pink to you); some brown waved lines near the base; then an oblique band; some waved brown lines from the costa to lower angle of cell; an oblique post-medial band; a highly waved and irregular whitish submarginal line; a dark ocellus (false eyespot) near outer angle. Hind wing flesh-color, the outer area brown; the disk suffused with pink; antemedial, medial, and two postmedial lines, the last two angled below the costa. Underside much mottled with yellow. 

Male and female moths have slight sexual dimorphism, where female abdomens are slightly wider and the wings have more streaking. 

The larvae are bright green with bluish-grey spiracles and also have yellow stripes across their anterior segments. At instars 3 and 4, they develop a green, conical, horn-like projection on the head, though this is lost in later instars, and the head becomes conical in shape. While moulting, the larvae would attach themselves with silk. 

''[[Amplypterus Mansoni]]'' has similar appearance and lifestyle, but has more pointed wingtips. 

== Behaviour ==
This moth is usually found at the canopy level of tropical forests, meaning that it is rarely seen. The moth is less active during the daytime and allows itself to be handled (though some may be less willing and may shift from side to side to avoid exposing the head to potential attackers), but at night it flies strongly. It has never been seen feeding at flowers, nor does it seem to come readily to light, though some sources states that it has frequently been caught at moth light traps in Java. It emerges from the pupa after dark, and only forms mating pairs after midnight (so elusive). In India, Bell &amp; Scott (1937) exposed bred females at about 1500m altitude and attracted eight males over four nights between 0300 and 0400 hours. Attempts to breed this species in captivity may fail, the males and females often refusing to pair. When threatened, this species exposes its pink-coloured hindwings. 

Larvae have been recorded on ''Dracontomelum'' (a kind of fruiting tree), ''Mangifera indica'' (mango tree), ''Rhus'' (a group of flowering plants), ''Durio'' (durians), ''Calophyllum'' (flowing plant type found in the tropics) and ''Garcinia'' (a tropical fruit tree).

inhabiting eastern North America. Papilio Glaucus is relatively common in a wide, avid range of habitats most commonly ranging from temperate hardwood forest, deciduous forests, sunny open patches of grass and meadows and even urban areas among gardens and parks.

== Morphology ==
Papilio Glaucus is a beautiful butterfly that is sexually dimorphic with Males having lemon yellow wings with irregular bands of Matt black with four black bands on the upper parts of the forewings hence the common name, Tiger swallowtail followed by gradient dark grey to black stripes aligning the margins and edges of the wings, the male’s hind wings appear yellow with faintly visible black stripes, females have sapphire-blue to sky blue scales adorning the edges of the hind wings. The vivid and brilliant features of The eastern tiger swallowtail makes it well-sought after species. The underside of the females hind wings sport vermillion blotches along the margins of the hind wings.

=== Juvenile ===
[[File:57758B00-0BF3-4E90-8271-DB3AF9DE98D7.jpeg|thumb|Fourth instar]]
Juveniles are born with a shade of dark brown and one single white band (known as a saddle) present on the thoracic region (upper side), later as the young larvae moult, they gain an additional white band (saddle) parallel to the first band , the juveniles also develop two ocelli present just above the head. Upon reaching the fourth molt, their colouring transitions to a lime-green colour making the ocelli more noticeable gradually developing multiple parallel vertical stripes of black, yellow and white on the upper side of the body, at this point they gain additional minuscule spots of lavender just beneath the first band (which is located above the head). The colour fades a brownish black as time fades away. eventually the caterpillars colouring fades to much lighter brown almost completely concealing the bands reaching 2 inches approximately in length .The caterpillar then proceeds to encase themselves in light green, leaf shaped pupa,

== Life Cycle ==
[[File:8DB782F6-9834-4CA6-ABF3-0D72EC14A44D.jpeg|thumb|Second instar]]
Their life begins on the leaves of Magnolia or  Rosaceae species, one egg for each leaf usually laid on the undersides, the eggs take anywhere between 3-10 days to hatch. The larvae have five instars. The pupation occurs before winters and ends during spring. The adults last from middle spring till autumn.

== Defensive mechanisms ==
[[File:920B13C5-3982-4AD3-B818-107009FE79FC.jpeg|thumb|Prior to pupation (Final Instar)]]
The first three instars are mimics of droppings The ocellus possessed by the third, fourth and fifth instars make the caterpillars appear similar to a snake in order to deter birds. The caterpillars possess an long, fleshy horn-like organ which protrudes from the upper thoracic region, it is known as an osmeturium and emits a pungent, foul odour to repel predators.

== Host Plants ==

* Wild black Cherry 
* Ash
* Cottonwood
* Wafer Ash
* Sweet magnolia 
* Tulip poplar
* Willow
* Aspens
* Birches

== Distribution ==
It is very common throughout America

They are, however, only a minority in the genus, which includes over 200 species of ''Solenopsis'' worldwide. ''Solenopsis'' are stinging ants and most of their common names reflect this, for example, ginger ants and tropical fire ants. Many species also are called red ants because of their light brown color, though species of ants in many other genera are similarly named for similar reasons. Examples include ''[[Myrmica rubra]]'' and ''[[Pogonomyrmex barbatus]]''.[2]

None of these names applies in all countries nor to all species of ''Solenopsis'', nor only to ''Solenopsis'' species; for example the colloquial names for several species of weaver ants in the genus ''[[Oecophylla]]'' in Southeast Asia include "fire ants" because of their red color and painful sting; the two genera, however, are not closely related. Also, ''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]'' is commonly called the "little fire ant".
==Appearance==
The bodies of mature fire ants, like the bodies of all typical mature insects, are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen, with three pairs of legs and a pair of antennae. Fire ants of those species invasive in the United States can be distinguished from other ants locally present, by their copper brown head and body with a darker abdomen. The worker ants are blackish to reddish, and their size varies from 2 to 6 mm (0.079 to 0.236 in). In an established nest these different sizes of ants all are present at the same time.[4]

''Solenopsis'' spp. ants can be identified by three body features—a pedicel with two nodes, an unarmed propodeum, and antennae with 10 segments plus a two-segmented club.[5] Many ants bite, and formicine ants can cause irritation by spraying formic acid; myrmecine ants like fire ants have a dedicated venom-injecting sting, which injects an alkaloid venom, as well as mandibles for biting.
==Behavior==
A typical fire ant colony produces large mounds in open areas, and feeds mostly on young plants and seeds. Fire ants often attack small animals and can kill them. Unlike many other ants, which bite and then spray acid on the wound, fire ants bite only to get a grip and then sting (from the abdomen) and inject a toxic alkaloid venom called Solenopsin, a compound from the class of piperidines. For humans, this is a painful sting, a sensation similar to what one feels when burned by fire (hence the name) and the after effects of the sting can be deadly to sensitive people.[7] Fire ants are more aggressive than most native species and so have pushed many species away from their local habitat. One such species that ''Solenopsis'' ants parasitically take advantage of are bees, such as ''[[Euglossa imperialis]]'', a non-social orchid bee species, from which the ants would enter the cells from below the nest and rob the cell's contents.[8] These ants are renowned for their ability to survive extreme conditions. They do not hibernate, but can survive cold conditions, although this is costly to fire ant populations as observed during several winters in Tennessee, where 80 to 90% of colonies died due to several consecutive days of extremely low temperatures.[9]

Fire ants nest in the soil, often near moist areas, such as river banks, pond shores, watered lawns, and highway shoulders. Usually, the nest will not be visible, as it will be built under objects such as timber, logs, rocks, or bricks. If there is no cover for nesting, dome-shaped mounds will be constructed, but these are usually only found in open spaces, such as fields, parks and lawns. These mounds can reach heights of 40 cm (16 in),[4] but can be even higher on heavier soils, standing at 1.0m in height and 1.5m in diameter.[10] Colonies are founded by small groups of queens or single queens. Even if only one queen survives, within a month or so, the colony can expand to thousands of individuals. Some colonies may be polygynous (having multiple queens per nest).

After emerging in the slave-maker nest, slave workers work as if they were in their own colony, while parasite workers only concentrate on replenishing the labor force from neighboring host nests, a process called slave raiding.

The slave-making ants are specialized to parasitize a single species or a group of related species, and they are often close relatives to their hosts, which is typical for social parasites. The slave-makers may either be permanent social parasites (thus depending on enslaved ants throughout their whole lives) or facultative slave-makers. The behavior is unusual among ants but has evolved several times independently.
==Terminology==
Theft of brood for the purpose of employing the stolen individual's efforts in support of the thief is called dulosis (from Greek doulos, "slave"), but the term "slave-making" is used in older literature and is still common.[1] Herbers (2007) considered the term offensive and suggested that "slave-making ants" should be replaced with "pirate ants", noting that pirates take captives and rely on forced labor. Further, "slave" could be replaced with "captive" and "dulosis" with "leistic behavior" (Greek for pirated spoils, leistos).[2]

A related type of social parasitism is called inquilinism, in which a reproductive enters a host colony, lays eggs, and relies on the host colony to rear its offspring. Unlike brood parasitism, the inquiline remains within the nest and typically its brood does not outnumber the host's brood.
===Obligate and facultative slave-makers===
Slave-making ants may either be permanent social parasites, thus depending on enslaved hosts ants throughout their whole lives[3] or facultative slave-makers. Facultative slave-making ants, like those in the ''Formica sanguinea'' complex, represent an intermediate parasitic group, between free-living species on the one hand, and obligatory slave-making species on the other. In laboratory tests, slaves were removed from colonies of ''Formica sanguinea'' and ''[[Polyergus rufescens]]''. The behavior of ''F. sanguinea'' changed dramatically within 30 days of slave removal, with workers becoming self-sufficient at feeding and brood care. Workers of ''Polyergus'', by contrast, were unable to care for their brood, and experienced high mortality.
==Raids==
Parasitized nests need to replenish the host workers periodically and this is achieved by raiding other nests in a process called slave raiding.[3][5] The parasite workers are specialized for conducting raids in a two-step process. First, scouts individually search for potential host nests. When successful, the scout returns to its nest and recruits nest-mates to initiate the raid, during which slave-maker ants seize brood and bring it back home.[6] A colony may capture 14,000 pupae in a single season.[7] Most slave-raiders capture only brood, but ''[[Strongylognathus]]'' sp. also enslave adult workers.[8]

In most parasite species, workers mark the way to its nest with pheromones and afterwards fellow slave-makers are attracted in a few seconds. Then they go quickly to the targeted host nest, attack it, and carry as many larvae and pupae as possible and return to their nest following the same trail marked by the pheromone.[5] ''[[Rossomyrmex]]'' is the only reported slave-maker that exclusively uses adult transport and single recruitment chain instead of pheromones during raids, a behavior probably constrained by the arid habitat: raids take place in early summer when soil surface temperature can reach up to 30 °C (86 °F), a temperature in which pheromones would quickly evaporate.[5]

Workers of the attacked nest can fight or flee. In the host species ''[[Proformica]]'', the most common behavior is flight, probably because hosts almost always lose fights.[5] Most studies on the raiding behavior of species in the ''F. sanguinea'' complex confirm that slave raiders usually rout their opponents, who typically flee in a state of panic alarm, and that aggressive encounters, when they occur, are brief and do not result in the death of adult individuals from either species. However, when large colonies of slave species offer resistance during raids, prolonged fighting is possible, and many workers of both species can be killed.[9]

Later, host workers emerging in the parasite nest will be imprinted on and integrated into the mixed colony where they rear the parasite brood, feed and groom the parasite workers, defend the nest against aliens, and even participate in raids,[6] including raids against their original colony.[10] Altruistic acts of slaves are thus directed toward unrelated individuals. One hypothesis suggests that slave deception is possible because slaves are captured as pupae and learn the slave-maker colony odor after emergence.[11]

However, in some cases, the enslaved ants rebel against their slave-maker ants, killing a large number of the slave-maker ant offspring.[12] The reason behind this is because "slaves can gain indirect fitness benefits by reducing parasite pressure on nearby host colonies, because these are often closely related to the slaves".[12] Thus, the slave ants protect their native colonies from further raids by slave-maker ants.

      <text bytes="16661" sha1="b33760ijdg0slnsukxd8nupnlffytuj" xml:space="preserve">[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]'''''Nothomyrmecia''''', also known as the '''dinosaur ant''' or '''dawn ant''', is a rare genus of ants consisting of a single species, ''Nothomyrmecia macrops''. These ants live in South Australia, nesting in old-growth mallee woodland and Eucalyptus woodland. The full distribution of ''Nothomyrmecia'' has never been assessed, and it is unknown how widespread the species truly is; its potential range may be wider if it does favour old-growth mallee woodland. Possible threats to its survival include habitat destruction and climate change. ''Nothomyrmecia'' is most active when it is cold because workers encounter fewer competitors and predators such as ''[[Camponotus]]'' and ''[[Iridomyrmex]]'', and it also increases hunting success. Thus, the increase of temperature may prevent them from foraging and very few areas would be suitable for the ant to live in. As a result, the IUCN lists the ant as Critically Endangered. 

As a medium-sized ant, ''Nothomyrmecia'' measures 9.7–11 mm (0.38–0.43 in). Workers are monomorphic, showing little morphological differentiation among one another. Mature colonies are very small, with only 50 to 100 individuals in each nest. Workers are strictly nocturnal and are solitary foragers, collecting arthropod prey and sweet substances such as honeydew from scale insects and other [[Hemiptera]]. They rely on their vision to navigate and there is no evidence to suggest that the species use chemicals to communicate when foraging, but they do use chemical alarm signals. A queen ant will mate with one or more males and, during colony foundation, she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. Queens are univoltine (they produce just one generation of ants each year). Two queens may establish a colony together, but only one will remain once the first generation of workers has been reared. 

''Nothomyrmecia'' was first described by Australian entomologist John S. Clark in 1934 from two specimens of worker ants. These were reportedly collected in 1931 near the Russell Range, inland from Israelite Bay in Western Australia. After its initial discovery, the ant was not seen again for four decades until a group of entomologists rediscovered it in 1977, 1,300 km (810 mi) away from the original reported site. Dubbed as the 'Holy Grail' of myrmecology, the ant was subject to great scientific interest after its rediscovery, attracting scientists from around the world.[2][3] In Poochera (the rediscovery site), pictures of the ant are stencilled on the streets, and it is perhaps the only town in the world that thrives off ant-based tourism. Some entomologists have suggested a relationship to the Baltic Eocene fossil ant genus ''[[Prionomyrmex]]'' based on morphological similarities, but this interpretation is not widely accepted by the entomological community. Owing to its body structure, ''Nothomyrmecia'' is regarded to be the most plesiomorphic ant alive and a 'living fossil', stimulating studies on its morphology, behaviour, ecology, and chromosomes.

==Description==
''Nothomyrmecia'' is a medium-sized ant measuring 9.7–11 mm (0.38–0.43 in) in length. Workers are monomorphic, meaning that there is little morphological differentiation among one another.[2][4][5] The mandibles, clypeus (one of the sclerites that make up the "face" of an arthropod or insect), antennae and legs are pale yellow. The hairs on the body are yellow, erect and long and abundant, but on the antennae and legs they are shorter and suberect (standing almost in an erect position). It shows similar characteristics to Myrmecia, and somewhat resembles Oecophylla, commonly known as weaver ants. Workers are strictly nocturnal (active mainly at night) but navigate by vision, relying on large compound eyes.[4][6] The mandibles are shorter than the head. They have 10 to 15 intermeshing teeth and are less specialized than those of ''[[Myrmecia]]'' and ''[[Prionomyrmex]]'', being elongate and triangular. The head is longer than it is wide and broader towards the back. The sides of the head are convex around the eyes. The long antennal scapes (the base of the antenna) extend beyond the occipital border, and the second segment of the funiculus (a series of segments between the base and club) is slightly longer than the first, third and fourth segment. The node, pronotum, epinotum and thorax are longer than broad, and the mesonotum is just as long as it is wide. The first segment of the gaster (the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma) is broader than long by a third and broader at the back than the front with strongly convex sides.[4][7] 

A long and retractable stinger is present at the rear of the abdomen. It has been described as "prominent and effective" and is capable of inflicting a painful sting to humans.[2][4] A 'sting bulb gland' is also present in ''Nothomyrmecia''; this is a small exocrine gland of unknown function, first discovered and named in 1990. It is situated in the basal part of the insect's sting, and is located between the two ducts of the venom gland and the Dufour's gland.[8] Despite its many plesiomorphic features, the sting apparatus of ''Nothomyrmecia'' is considered less primitive than those found in other ants such as ''[[Stigmatomma pallipes]]''.[9] It is the only known species of ant that contains both a sting and a 'waist' (i.e. it has no postpetiole between the first and second gastral segments).

Queens look similar to workers, but several morphological features distinguish the two castes from each other. The queen's body is usually larger. Ocelli are highly developed, but the eyes on the queen are not enlarged. The structure of the pterothorax (the wing-bearing area of the thorax) is consistent with other reproductive ants, but it does not occupy as much of its mesosomal bulk. The wings of the queens are reduced to the point that they are not functional (they are brachypterous).[2][11] Their wings are rudimentary and stubby, barely overlapping the first gastral segment. Males resemble those of ''Myrmecia'', but ''Nothomyrmecia'' males bear a single waist node. The wings on the male ant are not stubby like a queen's; rather they are long and fully developed, exhibiting a primitive venational complement. They have a jugal anal lobe (a portion of the hindwing), a feature found in many primitive ants, and basal hamuli (hook-like projections that link the forewings and hindwings). Most male specimens collected have two tibial spurs (spines located on the distal end of the tibia); the first spur is a long calcar and the second spur is short and thick. Adults have a stridulatory organ on the ventral side of the abdomen – unlike all other hymenopterans in which such organs are located dorsally.[2] 

In all castes, these ants have six maxillary palps (palps that serve as organs of touch and taste in feeding) and four labial palps (sensory structures on the labium), a highly primitive feature. The females have a 12-segmented antenna, whereas males have 13 segments. Other features include paired calcariae found on both the hind and middle tibiae, and the claws have a median tooth. The unspecialized nature of the cuticle (outer exoskeleton of the body) is similar to ''Pseudomyrmex'', a member of the subfamily Pseudomyrmecinae. Many of the features known in ''Nothomyrmecia'' are found in Ponerinae and Pseudomyrmecinae.

The eggs of ''Nothomyrmecia'' are similar to those of ''Myrmecia'', being subspherical and non-adhesive. The larvae bear a primitive body structure with no specialized tubercles, sharing similar characteristics with the subfamily Ponerinae, but the sensilla are more abundant on the mouthparts. The larvae are characterized into three stages: very young, young, and mature, measuring 2.8 mm (0.1 in), 6.3 mm (0.2 in) and 11 mm (0.4 in), respectively.[12] The cocoons have thin walls and produce meconium (a metabolic waste product expelled through the anal opening after an insect emerges from its pupal stage).[2] The cuticular hydrocarbons have internally branched alkenes, a feature rarely found in ants and most insects.[13] 

In general, the body structure of all ''Nothomyrmecia'' castes demonstrates the primitive nature of the species.[2] Notable derived features include vestigial ocelli on workers, brachypterous queens, and the mesoscutal structure on males. The morphology of the abdomen, mandibles, gonoforceps (a sclerite, serving as the base of the ovipositors sheath) and basal hamuli show it is more primitive than ''Myrmecia''. The structure of the abdominal region can separate it from other Myrmeciinae relatives (the fourth abdominal segment of ''Myrmecia'' is tubulate, whereas ''Nothomyrmecia'' has a non-tubulated abdominal segment). The appearance of the fourth abdominal segment is consistent with almost all aculeate insects, and possibly ''Sphecomyrma''.[2] 

The feature of non-functional, vestigial wings may have evolved in this species relatively recently, as wings might otherwise have long-since disappeared completely had they no function for dispersal. Wing-reduction could somehow relate to population structure or some other specialized ecological pressure. Equally, wing-reduction might be a feature that only forms in drought-stressed colonies, as has been observed in several ''[[Monomorium]]'' ant species found throughout semi-arid regions of Australia. As yet, scientists do not fully understand how the feature of non-functional, vestigial wings arose in ''Nothomyrmecia macrops''.

==Taxonomy==
===Discovery===
The first collection of ''Nothomyrmecia'' was made in December 1931 by amateur entomologist, Amy Crocker,[a] whose colleagues had collected a range of insect samples for her during a field excursion, including specimens of two worker ants, reportedly near the Russell Range, inland from Israelite Bay in Western Australia.[2][4] Crocker then passed the ants to Australian entomologist John S. Clark. Recognized shortly afterwards as a new species, these specimens became the syntypes.[4] Entomologist Robert W. Taylor subsequently expressed doubt about the accuracy of recording of the original discovery site, stating the specimens were probably collected from the western end of the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia.[2] The discovery of ''Nothomyrmecia'' and the appearance of its unique body structure led scientists in 1951 to initiate a series of searches to find the ant in Western Australia.[6] Over three decades, teams of Australian and American collectors failed to re-find it; entomologists such as E. O. Wilson and William Brown, Jr., made attempts to search for it, but neither was successful.[14] Then, on 22 October 1977, Taylor and his party of entomologists from Canberra serendipitously discovered a solitary worker ant at Poochera, South Australia, southeast of Ceduna, some 1,300 km (810 mi) from the reported site of the 1931 discovery.[2][15] In 2012, a report discussing the possible presence of ''Nothomyrmecia'' in Western Australia did not confirm any sighting of the ant between Balladonia and the Western Australian coastal regions.[16] After 46 years of searching for it, entomologists have dubbed the ant the 'Holy Grail' of myrmecology.

===Naming===
In 1934 entomologist John S. Clark published a formal description of ''Nothomyrmecia macrops'' as a new species and within a completely new genus and tribe (Nothomyrmecii) of the Ponerinae.[4] He did so because the two specimens (which then became the syntypes) bore no resemblance to any ant species he knew of, but they did share similar morphological characteristics with the extinct genus ''Prionomyrmex''. Clark notes that the head and mandibles of ''Nothomyrmecia'' and ''Prionomyrmex'' are somewhat similar, but the two can be distinguished by the appearance of the node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster).[4] In 1951, Clark proposed the new ant subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae for his ''Nothomyrmecia'', based on morphological differences with other ponerine ants.[19] This proposal was rejected by American entomologist William Brown Jr., who placed it in the subfamily Myrmeciinae with ''Myrmecia'' and ''Prionomyrmex'', under the tribe Nothomyrmeciini.[20] Its distant relationship with extant ants was confirmed after its rediscovery, and its placement within the Formicidae was accepted by most scientists until the late 1980s.[2][21] The single waist node led scientists to believe that ''Nothomyrmecia'' should be separate from ''Myrmecia'' and retained Clark's original proposal. This proposal would place the ant into its own subfamily, despite many familiar morphological characteristics between the two genera. This separation from ''Myrmecia'' was retained until 2000.

In 2000, entomologist Cesare Baroni Urbani described a new Baltic fossil ''Prionomyrmex'' species (P. janzeni). After examining specimens of ''Nothomyrmecia'', Baroni Urbani stated that his new species and ''N. macrops'' were so morphologically similar that they belonged to the same genus. He proposed that the name Prionomyrmex should replace the name ''Nothomyrmecia'' (which would then be just a synonym), and also that the subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae should be called Prionomyrmeciinae.[24] 

In 2003, Russian palaeoentomologists G. M. Dlussky and E. B. Perfilieva separated ''Nothomyrmecia'' from ''Prionomyrmex'' on the basis of the fusion of an abdominal segment.[25] In the same year, American entomologists P. S. Ward and S. G. Brady reached the same conclusion as Dlussky and Perfilieva and provided strong support for the monophyly of ''Prionomyrmex''. Ward and Brady also transferred both taxa as distinct genera in the older subfamily Myrmeciinae under the tribe Prionomyrmecini.[25][26] In 2005 and 2008, Baroni Urbani suggested further evidence in favor of his former interpretation as opposed to Ward and Brady's.[27][28] This view is not supported in subsequent relevant papers, which continue to use the classification of Ward and Brady, rejecting that of Baroni Urbani.[29][30][31][32] 

The ant is commonly known as the dinosaur ant, dawn ant, or living fossil ant because of its plesiomorphic body structure.[10][30][33] The generic name ''Nothomyrmecia'' means "false bulldog ant".[10] Its specific epithet, ''macrops'' ("big eyes"), is derived from the Greek words makros, meaning "long", or "large", and ops, meaning "eyes".

===Genetics and phylogeny===
Studies show that all hymenopteran insects that have a diploid (2n) chromosome count above 52 are themselves all ants; ''Nothomyrmecia'' and another Ponerinae ant, ''[[Platythyrea tricuspidata]]'', share the highest number of chromosomes within all the Hymenoptera, having a diploid chromosome number of 92–94.[2][36] 

Genetic evidence suggests that the age of the most recent common ancestor for ''Nothomyrmecia'' and ''Myrmecia'' is approximately 74 million years old, giving a likely origin in the Cretaceous.[26] There are two hypotheses of the internal phylogeny of ''Nothomyrmecia'': subfamily Formicinae is more closely related to ''Nothomyrmecia'' than it is to Myrmecia, evolving from Nothomyrmecia-like ancestors. Alternatively, Nothomyrmecia and Aneuretinae may have shared a common ancestor; the two most likely separated from each other, and the first formicines evolved from the Aneuretinae instead. Currently, scientists agree that Nothomyrmecia most likely evolved from ancestors to the Ponerinae.[37] ''Nothomyrmecia'' and other primitive ant genera such as ''[[Amblyopone]]'' and ''Myrmecia'' exhibit behavior similar to a clade of soil-dwelling families of vespoid wasps.[38] The following cladogram generated by Canadian entomologist S. B. Archibald and his colleagues shows the possible phylogenetic position of ''Nothomyrmecia'' among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae. They suggest that ''Nothomyrmecia'' may be closely related to extinct Myrmeciinae ants such as ''[[Avitomyrmex]]'', ''[[Macabeemyrma]]'', ''Prionomyrmex'', and ''[[Ypresiomyrma]]''.

They are endemic to the island of Borneo.

==Description==
''C. schmitzi'' closely resemble ''Colobopsis ceylonicus'' but are slightly larger. They have rectangular heads about one and a half times as long as they are wide. The mandibles have five teeth each (except for the minor workers which have four). The eyes are widely separated and located laterally, slightly behind the anterior bulge of the head. The antennae are short, with a scape at 1 mm (0.039 in) in length. The funicules are longer than they are wide proximally and become shorter and wider towards the tip. The body is smooth and shiny. The gaster is small. The legs are relatively large, especially the femurs, and very compressed laterally. Spines are present near the distal tip of the femurs and absent in the tibiae. The tarsi are longer than the tibiae.

''C. schmitzi'' exhibit polymorphism, with three physical castes - minor, median, and major ("soldier") workers. The queen averages at a length of 8 mm (0.31 in) with wings measuring 7 mm (0.28 in) long. The major and median workers are both 6.5 mm (0.26 in) in length, while the minor workers are 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.20 in) long. They are brownish-yellow to reddish-orange in color; the head and gaster are darker than the rest of the body.

The larvae are typical of ''Camponotus'' larvae - cylindrical in shape with the head and mouthparts bent at a 90 degree angle from the body.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Colobopsis schmitzi'' inhabits the hollow tendrils of the plant ''Nepenthes bicalcarata''. It is only found in association with ''N. bicalcarata'', which is endemic to the island of Borneo.

==Taxonomy==
''Camponotus schmitzi'' is classified in the genus ''[[Colobopsis]]'', which was formerly treated as a subgenus of ''[[Camponotus]]'', tribe Camponotini, and subfamily Formicinae of the ant family Formicidae. It was first collected by the botanist Jan Pieter Schuitemaker and described by the myrmecologist August Stärcke in 1933 as ''Camponotus schmitzi''.

'''Not to be confused for  ''[[Camptonotus]].'''''

== General ==
Camponotus is a genus of [[Formicidae]] (Ants) commonly known as the '''Carpenter ants.''' The genus consists of 1000+ species of ants from the tribe '''“Camponotini”''' and are found throughout the evergreen, deciduous and equatorial forests around the world. 

== Morphology ==
Morphological features vary from one species to another and all share a common morphological feature of “waists” and other physiological features considered “ant-like” in nature (waists, medium length antennae and sharp mandibles.

== Behaviour ==

=== Habitat ===
Carpenter ants mainly reside in decaying, or fresh wood notably preferring woody, large trees, wooden buildings, logs etc. causing devastating problems to wooden structures. The nests are made deep inside wooden builds and heartwoods of trees composed of intricate network patterns of tunnels. Common signs of habitation includes appearance of sawdust like wood shavings and, holes present on wooden structures. 

=== Communication ===
These ants communicate via pheromones or touch and possess great homing instincts. The queen possesses a unique ability of affecting colonies with a variety of odours, having distinctive effects on members of the colony aiding the queen in control over the hive-mind colonies. 

== Importance ==
Their unique abilities of excavation of wood helps in forests decomposition and increments in the presence and quality of hummus in soil. Some species are consumed as a food source for example, consumption of [[Camponotus Inflatus]] (Honeypot ants) by indigenous Australians&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpenter_ant#Pheromones&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Africanized honey bee was first introduced to Brazil in the 1950s in an effort to increase honey production; but, in 1957, 26 swarms accidentally escaped quarantine. Since then, the species has spread throughout South America, and arrived in North America in 1985. Hives were found in south Texas of the United States in 1990. This species was discovered to have spread into the American Northwest in 2011.[1]

Africanized bees are more aggressive, and react to disturbances faster than European honey bees. They can chase a person a quarter of a mile (400 m); they have killed some 1,000 humans, with victims receiving ten times more stings than from European honey bees.[2] They have also killed horses and other animals.
==History==
There are 28 recognized subspecies of ''Apis mellifera'' based largely on geographic variations. All subspecies are cross-fertile. Geographic isolation led to numerous local adaptations. These adaptations include brood cycles synchronized with the bloom period of local flora, forming a winter cluster in colder climates, migratory swarming in Africa, enhanced (long-distance) foraging behavior in desert areas, and numerous other inherited traits.

The Africanized honey bees in the Western Hemisphere are descended from hives operated by biologist Warwick E. Kerr, who had interbred honey bees from Europe and southern Africa. Kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions (i.e., more productive) than the European strain of honey bee currently in use throughout North, Central and South America. The hives containing this particular Africanized subspecies, were housed at an apiary near Rio Claro, São Paulo, in the southeast of Brazil and were noted to be especially defensive. These hives had been fitted with special excluder screens (called queen excluders) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of European bees. According to Kerr, in October 1957 a visiting beekeeper, noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees' movement, removed them resulting in the accidental release of 26 Tanganyikan swarms of ''A. m. scutellata''. Following this accidental release, the Africanized swarms spread out and cross-bred with local European colonies; their descendants have since spread throughout the Americas. Because their movement through South and Central America was rapid and largely unassisted by humans, Africanized bees have earned the reputation of being one of the most successful biologically invasive species of all time.

The first Africanized bees in the US were discovered in 1985 at an oil field in the San Joaquin Valley of California. "Bee experts theorized the colony had arrived hidden in a load of oil-drilling pipe shipped from South America."[4] The first permanent colonies arrived in Texas, from Mexico, in 1990. In the Tucson region of Arizona, a study of trapped swarms in 1994 found that only 15 percent had been Africanized; this number had grown to 90 percent by 1997.[5]

Though Africanized bees display certain behavioral traits that make them less than desirable for commercial beekeeping, excessive defensiveness and swarming foremost, they have now become the dominant type of honey bee for beekeeping in Central and South America due to their genetic dominance as well as ability to out-compete their European counterpart, with clear evidence that they are superior honey producers and pollinators.

The major differences between Africanized and other Western bee types are:
*Tends to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees.
*Is more likely to migrate as part of a seasonal response to lowered food supply.
*Is more likely to "abscond"—the entire colony leaves the hive and relocates—in response to stress.
*Has greater defensiveness when in a resting swarm, compared to other honey bee types.
*Lives more often in ground cavities than the European types.
*Guards the hive aggressively, with a larger alarm zone around the hive.
*Has a higher proportion of "guard" bees within the hive.
*Deploys in greater numbers for defense and pursues perceived threats over much longer distances from the hive.
*Cannot survive extended periods of forage deprivation, preventing introduction into areas with harsh winters or extremely dry late summers.
==Geographic spread throughout North America==
African honeybees are considered an invasive species in the Americas. As of 2002, the Africanized honeybees had spread from Brazil south to northern Argentina and north to Central America, Trinidad (West Indies), Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Florida, and southern California. Their expansion stopped for a time at eastern Texas, possibly due to the large population of honey bee hives in the area. However, discoveries of the Africanized bees in southern Louisiana indicate this subspecies has penetrated this barrier,[6] or has come as a swarm aboard a ship. In June 2005, it was discovered that the bees had penetrated the border of Texas and had spread into southwest Arkansas. On September 11, 2007, Commissioner Bob Odom of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry said that Africanized honey bees established themselves in the New Orleans area.[7] In February 2009, Africanized honeybees were found in southern Utah.[8][9] In October 2010, a 73-year-old man was killed by a swarm of Africanized honey bees while clearing brush on his south Georgia property, as determined by Georgia's Department of Agriculture. In 2012 state officials reported that a colony was found for the first time in a bee keepers colony in Monroe County, eastern Tennessee.[10] In June 2013, 62-year-old Larry Goodwin of Moody, TX was killed by a swarm of bees.[11]

In tropical climates they effectively out-compete European bees and, at their peak rate of expansion, they spread north at a rate of almost two kilometers (about one mile) a day. There were discussions about slowing the spread by placing large numbers of docile European-strain hives in strategic locations, particularly at the Isthmus of Panama, but various national and international agricultural departments were unable to prevent the bees' expansion. Current knowledge of the genetics of these bees suggests that such a strategy, had it been attempted, would not have been successful.[12]

As the Africanized honeybee migrates further north, colonies continue to interbreed with European honeybees. In a study conducted in Arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of Africanized bees were capable of taking over weakened European honey bee hives by invading the hive, then killing the European queen and establishing their own queen.[13] There are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either African bees dominate, a mix of African and European bees is present, or only non-African bees are found, as in the southern portions of South America or northern North America.

African honeybees abscond (abandon the hive and any food store to start over in a new location) more readily than European honeybees. This is not necessarily a severe loss in tropical climates where plants bloom all year but in more temperate climates it can leave the colony with insufficient stores to survive the winter. Thus Africanized bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the Southern States of the United States, reaching as far north as the Chesapeake Bay in the east. The cold-weather limits of the African bee have driven some professional bee breeders from Southern California into the harsher wintering locales of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range. This is a more difficult area to prepare bees for early pollination placement in, such as is required for the production of almonds. The reduced available winter forage in northern California means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup.

The arrival of the Africanized honey bee in Central America is threatening the ancient art of keeping ''[[Melipona]]'' [[stingless bee]]s in log gums even though they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other. The honey production from a single hive of Africanized bees can be 100 kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3–5 kg of the various ''Melipona'' stingless species. Thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the Africanized honey bee. Whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown, but they are well adapted to exist in the wild, and there are a number of indigenous plants that the Africanized honey bees do not visit, so their fate remains to be seen.

Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies,[1] though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000[2] known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus Apis are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees is known as melittology.
==Etymology and name==
The genus name Apis is Latin for "bee".[3]

Although modern dictionaries may refer to Apis as either honey bee or honeybee, entomologist Robert Snodgrass explains that correct usage is to use two words, i.e. honey bee, as it is a kind or type of bee, whereas it is incorrect to run the two words together as in dragonfly or butterfly, because the latter are not flies.[4] Honey bee, not honeybee, is the listed common name in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, the Entomological Society of America Common Names of Insects Database, and the Tree of Life Web Project.
==Origin, systematics and distribution==
Honey bees appear to have their center of origin in South and Southeast Asia (including the Philippines), as all the extant species except ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' are native to that region. Notably, living representatives of the earliest lineages to diverge (''[[Apis florea]]'' and ''[[Apis andreniformis]]'') have their center of origin there.[8]

The first Apis bees appear in the fossil record at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary (34 mya), in European deposits. The origin of these prehistoric honey bees does not necessarily indicate Europe as the place of origin of the genus, only that the bees were present in Europe by that time. Few fossil deposits are known from South Asia, the suspected region of honey bee origin, and fewer still have been thoroughly studied.

No Apis species existed in the New World during human times before the introduction of ''A. mellifera'' by Europeans. Only one fossil species is documented from the New World, ''[[Apis nearctica]]'', known from a single 14-million-year-old specimen from Nevada.[9]

The close relatives of modern honey bees – e.g. bumblebees and stingless bees – are also social to some degree, and social behavior seems a plesiomorphic trait that predates the origin of the genus. Among the extant members of Apis, the more basal species make single, exposed combs, while the more recently evolved species nest in cavities and have multiple combs, which has greatly facilitated their domestication.

Most species have historically been cultured or at least exploited for honey and beeswax by humans indigenous to their native ranges. Only two of these species have been truly domesticated, one (''A. mellifera'') at least since the time of the building of the Egyptian pyramids, and only that species has been moved extensively beyond its native range.

Honey bees are the only extant members of the tribe Apini. Today's honey bees constitute three clades.
===Genetics===
The chromosome counts of female bees for the three clades are: Micrapis 2N = 16, Megapis 2N = 16, and Apis 2N = 32. Drones of all species have 1N chromosome counts. The genome of Apis has been mapped.

Drones (males) are produced from unfertilized eggs, so represent only the DNA of the queen that laid the eggs, i.e. have only a mother. Workers and queens (both female) result from fertilized eggs, so have both a mother and a father. Arrhenotokous parthenogenesis, a modified form of parthenogenesis, controls sex differentiation. The sex allele is polymorphic, and so long as two different variants are present, a female bee results. If both sex alleles are identical, diploid drones are produced. Honey bees detect and destroy diploid drones after the eggs hatch.

Queens typically mate with multiple drones on more than one mating flight. Once mated, they lay eggs and fertilize them as needed from sperm stored in the spermatheca. Since the number of sex alleles is limited – about 18 are known in Apis – a queen will most likely mate with one or more drones having sex alleles identical with one of the sex alleles in the queen. The queen, then, typically produces a percentage of diploid drone eggs.
====''Micrapis''====
''Apis florea'' and ''Apis andreniformis'' are small honey bees of southern and southeastern Asia. They make very small, exposed nests in trees and shrubs. Their stings are often incapable of penetrating human skin, so the hive and swarms can be handled with minimal protection. They occur largely sympatrically, though they are very distinct evolutionarily and are probably the result of allopatric speciation, their distribution later converging. Given that ''A. florea'' is more widely distributed and ''A. andreniformis'' is considerably more aggressive, honey is, if at all, usually harvested from the former only. They are the most ancient extant lineage of honey bees, maybe diverging in the Bartonian (some 40 million years ago or slightly later) from the other lineages, but do not seem to have diverged from each other a long time before the Neogene.[10] ''Apis florea'' have smaller wing spans than its sister species.[11] ''Apis florea'' are also completely yellow with the exception of the scutellum of workers, which is black.
====''Megapis''====
One species is recognized in the subgenus ''Megapis''. It usually builds single or a few exposed combs on high tree limbs, on cliffs, and sometimes on buildings. They can be very fierce. Periodically robbed of their honey by human "honey hunters", colonies are easily capable of stinging a human being to death if provoked.
*''Apis dorsata'', the giant honey bee, is native and widespread across most of South and Southeast Asia. 
**''A. d. binghami'', the Indonesian honey bee, is classified as the Indonesian subspecies of the giant honey bee or a distinct species; in the latter case, ''A. d. breviligula'' and/or other lineages would probably also have to be considered species.[12]
**''A. d. laboriosa'', the Himalayan honey bee, was initially described as a distinct species. Later, it was included in ''A. dorsata'' as a subspecies[1] based on the biological species concept, though authors applying a genetic species concept have suggested it should be considered a species.[10] Essentially restricted to the Himalayas, it differs little from the giant honey bee in appearance, but has extensive behavioral adaptations that enable it to nest in the open at high altitudes despite low ambient temperatures. It is the largest living honey bee.
====''Apis''====
The eastern species include three or four species. The reddish Koschevnikov's bee (''[[Apis koschevnikovi]]'') from Borneo is well distinct; it probably derives from the first colonization of the island by cave-nesting honey bees. ''[[Apis cerana]]'', the eastern honey bee proper, is the traditional honey bee of southern and eastern Asia, kept in hives in a similar fashion to ''A. mellifera'', though on a much smaller and regionalized scale. It has not been possible yet to resolve its relationship to the Bornean ''A. c. nuluensis'' and ''[[Apis nigrocincta]]'' from the Philippines to satisfaction; the most recent hypothesis is that these are indeed distinct species, but that ''A. cerana'' is still paraphyletic, consisting of several good species.

''A. mellifera'', the most common domesticated species, was the third insect to have its genome mapped. It seems to have originated in eastern tropical Africa and spread from there to Northern Europe and eastwards into Asia to the Tien Shan range. It is variously called the European, western or common honey bee in different parts of the world. Many subspecies have adapted to the local geographic and climatic environments; in addition, hybrid strains, such as the [[Buckfast bee]], have been bred. Behavior, color, and anatomy can be quite different from one subspecies or even strain to another.

Regarding phylogeny, this is the most enigmatic honey bee species. It seems to have diverged from its eastern relatives only during the Late Miocene. This would fit the hypothesis that the ancestral stock of cave-nesting honey bees was separated into the western group of East Africa and the eastern group of tropical Asia by desertification in the Middle East and adjacent regions, which caused declines of food plants and trees that provided nest sites, eventually causing gene flow to cease. The diversity of subspecies is probably the product of a largely Early Pleistocene radiation aided by climate and habitat changes during the last ice age. That the western honey bee has been intensively managed by humans for many millennia – including hybridization and introductions – has apparently increased the speed of its evolution and confounded the DNA sequence data to a point where little of substance can be said about the exact relationships of many ''A. mellifera'' subspecies.[10]

''Apis mellifera'' is not native to the Americas, so was not present upon the arrival of the European explorers and colonists. However, other native bee species were kept and traded by indigenous peoples.[13] In 1622, European colonists brought the dark bee (''A. m. mellifera'') to the Americas, followed later by [[Italian bee]]s (''A. m. ligustica'') and others. Many of the crops that depend on honey bees for pollination have also been imported since colonial times. Escaped swarms (known as "wild" bees, but actually feral) spread rapidly as far as the Great Plains, usually preceding the colonists. Honey bees did not naturally cross the Rocky Mountains; they were transported by the Mormon pioneers[14] to Utah in the late 1840s, and by ship to California in the early 1850s.

====[[Africanized bee]]====
Africanized bees (known colloquially as "killer bees") are hybrids between European stock and one of the African subspecies ''A. m. scutellata''; they are often more aggressive than European bees and do not create as much of a honey surplus, but are more resistant to disease and are better foragers.[citation needed] Originating by accident in Brazil, they have spread to North America and constitute a pest in some regions. However, these strains do not overwinter well, so are not often found in the colder, more northern parts of North America. The original breeding experiment for which the African bees were brought to Brazil in the first place has continued (though not as intended). Novel hybrid strains of domestic and redomesticated Africanized bees combine high resilience to tropical conditions and good yields. They are popular among beekeepers in Brazil.

and eastern Asia. This species is the sister species of ''Apis koschevnikovi'' and both are in the same subgenus as the western (European) honey bee, ''Apis mellifera''. ''A. cerana'' is known to live sympatrically along with ''Apis koschevnikovi'' within the same geographic location. ''Apis cerana'' colonies are known for building nests consisting of multiple combs in cavities containing a small entrance, presumably for defense against invasion by individuals of another nest. The diet of this honey bee species consists mostly of pollen and nectar, or honey. Moreover, ''Apis cerana'' is known for its highly social behavior, reflective of its classification as a type of honey bee.

The terms ''Apis cerana indica'' and ''Apis Indica'' or Indian honey bee, is an historic term, with all Asian hive bees now referred to as ''Apis cerana''. 

&lt;br /&gt;

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius described ''Apis cerana'', also known as the eastern or Asian honey bee, in 1793. The genus name ''Apis'' is Latin for "bee". The eastern honey bee is of the Apidae family, one of the most diverse families of bees, including honey bees, carpenter bees, orchid bees, bumblebees, cuckoo bees, and even stingless bees. In the past, there has been discussion that ''Apis cerana'' and ''Apis mellifera'' are simply distinct races of the same species. This is essentially due to overwhelming similarities in both morphology and behavior, as both are medium-sized bees (10-11mm) that generally build multiple comb nests inside cavities. Other honey bee species, including the giant honey bees ''Apis dorsata'' and ''Apis laboriosa'', generally construct nests consisting of a single comb in open areas. However, despite the striking similarities between ''Apis cerana'' and ''Apis mellifera'', there is evidence to suggest that these two species are quite distinct; for example, mating between these species does not produce offspring. In addition, while ''Apis mellifera'' colonies can reach sizes of up to 50,000 or more individuals, ''Apis cerana'' colonies are relatively small, with only around 6,000 to 7,000 workers. Moreover, ''Apis cerana'' is found predominantly in the Eastern Asian region of the world, while ''Apis mellifera'' is found predominantly in the Western European and African region of the world. For these reasons, it has now been concluded that these are in fact two separate species, contrary to prior beliefs. 

=== Infraspecies grouping ===
Historically, ''Apis cerana'' has been subdivided into eight subspecies according to Engel (1999) they are:

* [[Apis cerana Fabricius|''Apis cerana'' Fabricius]] (= ''sinensis'') ('''Chinese honey bee''') - Afghanistan, Pakistan, northern India, northern Vietnam, southern and coastal China, Taiwan, South Korea and North Korea and Primorsky Krai in Russia
* ''Apis cerana heimifeng'' Engel ('''black Chinese honey bee''') - highlands in central China
* [[Apis cerana indica Fabricius|''Apis cerana indica'' Fabricius]] ('''Indian honey bee''') - southern India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh
* ''A[[Apis cerana japonica|pis cerana japonica]]'' [[Apis cerana japonica|Fabricius]] ('''Japanese honey bee''') - Japan
* [[Apis cerana javana Enderlein|''Apis cerana javana'' Enderlein]] ('''Javan honey bee''') - Java to East Timor
* [[Apis cerana johni Skorikov|''Apis cerana johni'' Skorikov]] ('''Sumatran honey bee''') - Sumatra
* [[Honey bee|''Apis cerana nuluensis'' Tingek]], Koeniger and Koeniger ('''Bornean honey bee''') - Borneo
* [[Honey bee|''Apis cerana skorikovi'' Engel]] (= ''himalaya'') ('''Himalayan honey bee''') - the central and eastern Himalayan mountains (Ruttner, 1987)

Recent genetic analysis, however, has determined that some of the subspecies described may have been inadvertent misidentifications of very similar sympatric species, including ''Apis koschevnikovi'' of Borneo and ''Apis nigrocincta'' of the Philippines. ''Apis cerana nuluensis'' of Borneo is also now generally considered to be a separate species, as ''Apis nuluensis''. 

== Distribution and habitat ==
''Apis cerana'' encompass a wide range of climatic zones including moist tropical rainforests, wet-dry tropical savannas, mid-latitude steppes, dry mid-latitude grasslands, moist continental deciduous forests, and taigas. The natural range of ''Apis cerana'' extends from Primorsky Krai in Russia in the north, to eastern Indonesia in the south; and to Japan in the east, to as far as the highlands of Afghanistan in the west. Countries they are native to include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. It was introduced deliberately to New Guinea in the 1970s, and has since spread into the Torres Strait Islands into Australia and the Solomon Islands. Although the species was naturally clustered in East Asia, it has now expanded to various regions across the world as a result of human interference, with particular concern about its invasive potential in Australia as nests are found in a variety of environments, including both natural and man-made
&lt;br /&gt;

== Behavior ==

=== Colony cycle ===
The colony of ''Apis cerana'', a typical honey bee, consists of several thousand female worker bees, one queen bee, and several hundred male drone bees. The colony is constructed inside beeswax combs inside a tree cavity, with a special peanut-shaped structure on the margins of the combs where the queens are reared.

The colony's annual cycle in cold temperature regions begins shortly after the winter solstice, when the colony raises the core temperature of its cluster to about 34 degrees Celsius and starts to rear brood. At first, only around 100 bees are produced, but several thousand bees are developing by early spring. By late spring, the colony will have already attained full size, and will begin to reproduce. The colony then rears several new queens, and divides itself with about half the workers plus the old queen once the new queens have nearly matured. This new swarm then flies to a new tree branch, explores nest cavities, and then directs the other bees to the new site once satisfied with the location.

During the remainder of summer and into the fall, the colonies in the new locations build combs, rear brood, and gather food to quickly rebuild their populations and food reserves prior to the arrival of winter.

=== Division of labor ===
As a social species, ''Apis cerana'' colonies contain divisions of labor depending on what each member of the group is specialized to perform. There is generally only one queen bee whose sole responsibility it is to lay eggs; therefore, she is the mother of all the workers present in the colony. Apart from the queen bee, the remaining female bees are known as the worker bees, as these individuals perform all the tasks necessarily to maintain the hive including tending to the eggs, larvae, and pupae, foraging for food and water, cleaning the facility, and producing honey. These tasks are divided among the female worker bees by a factor of age. The remaining individuals are the males, known as the “drones,” whose only responsibility is to mate with queen from another colony; therefore, drones are solely produced during the reproductive season.

=== Communication ===
The principal method of communication is the waggle dance, performed primarily when a worker bee discovers a rich source of pollen or nectar and wishes to share this knowledge with her fellow nest-mates. The waggle dance occurs deep inside the colony's hive, where the worker bee performs a brief reenactment of the recent journey to a patch of flowers. Neighboring bees observe and learn this dance and can then follow the same pattern, utilizing the odor of the flowers to fly in a certain path and arrive at the same destination. The bees following the informed worker bee will extend their antennae towards the dancer in order to detect the dance sounds, as the frequency of the bee's antennae closely matches the vibration frequency of its wings. The overall direction and duration of each waggle is closely correlated with the direction and distance from the flower patch being described.

=== Mating behavior ===
Within the honey bee colony, a queen bee typically mates with 10 or more males. This extensive mating is performed in an effort to secure a great range of genetic variation in her colony to cope with diseases, as well as respond to nectar sources and a wide range of external stimuli. Apart from the queen bee, the only other sexual members of the society are the male drones, whose only function is to mate with the queen, after which they will die.

The exact time and place of ''Apis cerana'' mating is specific to the subspecies, often varying by local environment. For instance, in Sri Lanka, ''Apis cerana'' males typically aggregate beside a tree canopy as opposed to above a tree as is found in the ''Apis cerana'' subspecies of Japan. The most significant factor in determining mating time, however, is not ecological conditions, but rather the presence of drones of other species. Mating time decreases as the number of non-species drones present increases.

==== Reproductive swarming ====
In ''A. cerana'', reproductive swarming is similar to ''A. mellifera''. ''A. cerana'' reproductive swarms settle 20–30 m away from the natal nest (the mother or primary colony) and stay for a few days before departing for a new nest site after getting information from scout bees. Scout bees search for suitable cavities in which to construct the swarm's home. Successful scouts come back and report the location of suitable nesting sites to the other bees by performing communication dances on the surface of the swarm cluster in the same way as for food sources.

===== Absconding behavior =====
Apart from reproductive swarming, ''A. cerana'' has migration and absconding behavior, abandoning the current nest and building a new nest in a new location where an abundant supply of nectar and pollen is available. These bees usually do not store great amounts of honey, so they are more vulnerable to starvation if a prolonged shortage of nectar and pollen occurs. Absconding will start when not enough pollen and nectar are available. After the last brood emerges, the adult bees fill their honey stomachs from the hive's stores and swarm to establish a new nest at a new location. ''A. cerana'' has more absconding behavior than ''A. mellifera''.

This invasive species of honey bee originally came from africa and is much faster in swarms then the native European honey bees. They 

spead by invading other hives.

First they do a movment and get the other bees to let them in, then they get their queen into the hive and she lays her own eggs and they kill all the larvae and workers and take over the hive.

honey bees found worldwide except desolated arid regions. These insects are primarily responsible for the production of the natural sweetener, delicious honey!

&lt;br /&gt;

== Behavior ==
The genus name ''Apis'' is Latin for "bee", and ''mellifera'' is the Latin for "honey-bearing", referring to the species' production of honey. Like all honey bee species, the western honey bee is eusocial, creating colonies with a single fertile female responsible for the entire population and existence for the entire colon , many normally non-reproductive females workers honeybees, and a small proportion of male honeybees. Individual colonies can house tens thousands of Individual western honeybees. Colonies of Western honeybees are organized by complex communication between individuals, through both pheromones and the dance language. Known as the waggle dance where a honeybee informs the colony about predators and food sources nearby by walking in ∞ like pattern.

The western honey bee was the very first domesticated honeybees, and it is the primary species maintained by beekeepers to this day for both its honey production and pollination activities, more than 80% of the plants worldwide depend upon pollination as the main source of their existence other than soil, sunlight, water and nutrition-rich nitrogen amonium salts mixed with decayed manure in the soil. under the human assistance, the western honey bee now occupies every continent except Antarctica and several other desolated areas around the world. Western honey bees are threatened by pests, diseases, and fungal and bacterial infections especially the [[Varroa destructor|''Varroa'' mite]] and [[Varroa destructor|colony collapse disorder.]] As of 2018, the western honey bee is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List, as numerous amounts of specialized studies indicate that the species has undergone significant declines in Europe due to parasites, infections and unsuitable climatic  conditions. however, it is not clear if they refer to population reduction of managed colonies. Further research is required to enable differentiation between wild and non-wild colonies in order to determine the conservation status of the species in the wild.

=== The colony ===
[[File:Apis mellifera scutellata.jpg|thumb|252x252px]]
There are different types of occupations each individual bee from a colony posses performing a specific kind of role beneficial for the entire colony and ensure their existence, Apis mellifera is able to repopulate their hive only under human captivity that they're adapted to. The colony can house more than 3000 individual members helping in the entire composition of the colony, Including a single queen responsible for populating the beehive, queens are the only members of the colony that are dominant as they are responsible for the entire colony's survival Honeybee hives have no hope for further existence under the absence of the queen, the honeybees are completely passive if they do not belong to any colony and will swarm up and bask on a tree branch. These bees can offer a highly toxic sting which gives off a constant burning feel to the wound, how to get rid of the wound is mentioned further in the article. The worker bees pollinate flowers and carry pollen and nectar, nectar is used for making honey primarily used for the creation of honey which is used to feed the larva of the honeybees until they pupate. Unlike most other bee species, western honey bees have perennial colonies which persist year after year. Because of this high degree of sociality and permanence, western honey bee colonies can be considered superorganisms. This means that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit. Western honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called "swarming". In most climates, western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer, when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect nectar and pollen. In response to these favorable conditions, the hive creates one to two dozen new queens. Just as the pupal stages of these "daughter queens" are nearly complete, the old queen and approximately two-thirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm, traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive (e.g., a hollow tree trunk). In the old colony, the daughter queens often start "piping", just prior to emerging as adults, and, when the daughter queens eventually emerge, they fight each other until only one remains; the survivor then becomes the new queen. If one of the sisters emerges before the others, she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae, before they have a chance to emerge as adults.Once she has dispatched all of her rivals, the new queen, the only fertile female, lays all the eggs for the old colony, which her mother has left. Virgin females are able to lay eggs, which develop into males (a trait shared with wasps, bees, and ants because of haplodiploidy). However, she requires a mate to produce female offspring, which comprise 90% or more of bees in the colony at any given time. Thus, the new queen goes on one or more nuptial flights, each time mating with 1–17 drones. Once she has finished mating, usually within two weeks of emerging, she remains in the hive, playing the primary role of laying eggs. Throughout the rest of the growing season, the colony produces many workers, who gather pollen and nectar as cold-season food; the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40,000 to 80,000 bees. Nectar from flowers is processed by worker bees, who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold, transforming it into honey, which can then be capped over with wax and stored almost indefinitely. In the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted, the bees gather in their hive and wait out the cold season, during which the queen may stop laying. During this time, activity is slow, and the colony consumes its stores of honey used for metabolic heat production in the cold season. In mid- through late winter, the queen starts laying again. This is probably triggered by day length. Depending on the subspecies, new queens (and swarms) may be produced every year, or less frequently, depending on local environmental conditions and a number of characteristics inside the hive. 

== Metamorphosis ==
Like other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, the western honey bee has four distinct life stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The complex social structure of western honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year. The queen deposits a single egg into each cell of a honeycomb prepared by worker bees. The egg hatches into a legless, eyeless larva fed by "nurse" bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week, the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage. After another week, it emerges as an adult bee. It is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees (also called "brood"), while others are filled with pollen and honey stores. Worker bees secrete the wax used to build the hive, clean, maintain and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen; the nature of the worker's role varies with age. For the first 10 days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells.

'''Bees''' are insects with wings closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea. They are presently considered a clade, called '''Anthophila'''. There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. Some species – including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees – live socially in colonies while most species (&gt;90%) – including mason bees, carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, and sweat bees – are solitary. Bees are found on every continent except for Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species, whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long, to ''Megachile pluto'', the largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54 in).Bees feed on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for their larvae. Vertebrate predators of bees include primates and birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially, and the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees. The analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.Human beekeeping or apiculture (meliponiculture for stingless bees) has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature from ancient times to the present day, although primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere where beekeeping is far more common. In Mesoamerica, the Mayans have practiced large-scale intensive meliponiculture since pre-Columbian times. The ancestors of bees were wasps in the family Crabronidae, which were predators of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasps, where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors. The oldest non-compression bee fossil is found in New Jersey amber, ''Cretotrigona prisca'', a corbiculate bee of Cretaceous age (~65 mya). A fossil from the early Cretaceous (~100 mya), ''Melittosphex burmensis'', was initially considered "an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea sister to the modern bees", but subsequent research has rejected the claim that ''Melittosphex'' is a bee, or even a member of the superfamily Apoidea to which bees belong, instead treating the lineage as ''incertae sedis'' within the Aculeata. By the Eocene (~45 Mya) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages.The highly eusocial corbiculate Apidae appeared roughly 87 Mya, and the Allodapini (within the Apidae) around 53 Mya. The Colletidae appear as fossils only from the late Oligocene (~25 Mya) to early Miocene. The Melittidae are known from ''Palaeomacropis eocenicus'' in the Early Eocene. The Megachilidae are known from trace fossils (characteristic leaf cuttings) from the Middle Eocene. The Andrenidae are known from the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, around 34 Mya, of the Florissant shale. The Halictidae first appear in the Early Eocene with species found in amber. The Stenotritidae are known from fossil brood cells of Pleistocene age.

== Morphology ==
bees differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (hairs), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in limb structure, and the venation of the hind wings; and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.

Bees have the following characteristics:

* A pair of large compound eyes which cover much of the surface of the head. Between and above these are three small simple eyes (ocelli) which provide information on light intensity.
* The antennae usually have 13 segments in males and 12 in females, and are geniculate, having an elbow joint part way along. They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors), smell and taste; and small, hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to "hear" sounds.
* The mouthparts are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandibles and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar.
* The thorax has three segments, each with a pair of robust legs, and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight, and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing.
* The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.

== [[Honey bee|Honey bees]] ==
A '''honey bee''' (or '''honeybee''') is any bee member of the genus ''Apis'', primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies,  though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000[  known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus Apis are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees is known as melittology. he genus name Apis is Latin for "bee". Although modern dictionaries may refer to Apis as either honey bee or honeybee, entomologist Robert Snodgrass explains that correct usage is to use two words, i.e. honey bee, as it is a kind or type of bee, whereas it is incorrect to run the two words together as in dragonfly or butterfly, because the latter are not flies.[4] Honey bee, not honeybee, is the listed common name in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, the Entomological Society of America Common Names of Insects Database, and the Tree of Life Web Project.

The bombus family is the family of all the bumble-bees.  '''bumblebee'''  is any of over 250 species in the genus Bombus,

{{Infobox_100|title1=Bombus|image1=Volucella bombylans (2).png|caption1=Volucella bombylans is perhaps the largest of the known species.|order=[[Hymenoptera]]|phylum=[[Arthropoda]]|class=Insecta|family=[[Apidae]]}}

part of Apidae, one of the bee families. This genus is the only extant group in the tribe Bombini, though a few extinct related genera (e.g., ''Calyptapis'') are known from fossils. They are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, although they are also found in South America, where a few lowland tropical species have been identified. European bumblebees have also been introduced to New Zealand and Tasmania. Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals.

Most bumblebees are social insects that form colonies with a single queen. The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. Cuckoo bumblebees are brood parasitic and do not make nests or form colonies; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers. Cuckoo bumblebees were previously classified as a separate genus, but are now usually treated as members of ''Bombus''.

Bumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair (long branched setae) called 'pile', making them appear and feel fuzzy. They have aposematic (warning) coloration, often consisting of contrasting bands of colour, and different species of bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective Müllerian mimicry. Harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees, in Batesian mimicry, and may be confused with them. Nest-making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large, fuzzy cuckoo bees by the form of the female hind leg. In nesting bumblebees, it is modified to form a pollen basket, a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen, whereas in cuckoo bees, the hind leg is hairy all round, and they never carry pollen.

Like their relatives the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar to add to the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees steal nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.

== Taxonomy ==


The genus ''Bombus'', the only one extant genus in the tribe Bombini, comprises over 250 species; for an overview of the differences between bumblebees and other bees and wasps, see characteristics of common wasps and bees. The genus has been divided variously into up to 49 subgenera, a degree of complexity criticised by Williams (2008). The cuckoo bumblebees ''Psithyrus'' have sometimes been treated as a separate genus but are now considered to be part of ''Bombus'', in one or more subgenera.

Examples of ''Bombus'' species include ''Bombus atratus'', ''Bombus dahlbomii'', ''Bombus fervidus'', ''Bombus lapidarius'', ''Bombus ruderatus'', and ''Bombus rupestris.''

== Morphology ==
Bumblebees vary in appearance, but are generally plump and densely furry. They are larger, broader and stouter-bodied than honeybees, and their abdomen tip is more rounded. Many species have broad bands of colour, the patterns helping to distinguish different species. Whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly pollinate open flowers, some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed into a tube. Bumblebees have fewer stripes (or none), and usually have part of the body covered in black fur, while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on the abdomen. Sizes are very variable even within species; the largest British species, ''B. terrestris'', has queens up to 22 mm (0.9 in) long, males up to 16 mm (0.6 in) long, and workers between 11 and 17 mm (0.4–0.7 in) long. The largest bumblebee species in the world is ''B. dahlbomii'' of Chile, up to about 40 mm (1.6 in) long, and described as "flying mice" and "a monstrous fluffy ginger beast".
&lt;br /&gt;

== Distribution and habitat ==
Bumblebees are typically found in temperate climates, and are often found at higher latitudes and altitudes than other bees, although a few lowland tropical species exist. A few species (''B. polaris'' and ''B. alpinus'') range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found; ''B. polaris'' occurs in northern Ellesmere Island in the high Arctic, along with another bumblebee ''B. hyperboreus'', which parasitises its nest. This is the northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect. One reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature, via solar radiation, internal mechanisms of "shivering" and radiative cooling from the abdomen (called heterothermy). Other bees have similar physiology, but the mechanisms seem best developed and have been most studied in bumblebees. They adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude. Bumblebees have a largely cosmopolitan distribution but are absent from Australia (apart from Tasmania where they have been introduced) and are found in Africa only north of the Sahara. More than a hundred years ago they were also introduced to New Zealand, where they play an important role as efficient pollinators.

== Behavior ==

=== Feeding ===
The bumblebee tongue (the proboscis) is a long, hairy structure that extends from a sheath-like modified maxilla. The primary action of the tongue is lapping, that is, repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid. The tip of the tongue probably acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn from experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like ''Bombus bifarius'', have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, ''B. bifarius'' workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, which resulted in a small reward.

=== Wax production ===
The exoskeleton of the abdomen is divided into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on the abdomen and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff. It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs, moulded until malleable and used in the construction of honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.

=== Coloration ===
Cuckoo bumblebees, like this ''Bombus barbutellus'', have similar aposematic (warning) coloration to nest-making bumblebees, and may also mimic their host species.

The brightly coloured pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic (warning) signal, given that females can inflict a painful sting. Depending on the species and morph, the warning colours range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. Dipteran flies in the families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or warble flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies, such as ''Bombylius major'') all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.

=== Sting ===
Queen and worker bumblebees can sting. Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's stinger lacks barbs, so the bee can sting repeatedly without leaving the stinger in the wound and thereby injuring itself. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may sting in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed. The sting is painful to humans, and not medically significant in most cases, although it may trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals.

bees—bumblebees, honey bees, orchid bees, stingless bees, and the extinct genus ''Euglossopteryx''. It also includes all but two of the groups (excluding Nomadinae and Xylocopinae) that were previously classified in the family Anthophoridae.

Most species in the subfamily (other than honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees) are solitary, though several of the tribes are entirely cleptoparasitic, such as the Ericrocidini, Isepeolini, Melectini, Osirini, Protepeolini, and Rhathymini.

== Behaviors ==
Certain behaviors are known from members of the Apinae that are rarely seen in other bees, including the habit of males forming "sleeping aggregations" on vegetation - several males gathering on a single plant in the evening, grasping a plant with their jaws and resting there through the night (sometimes held in place only by the jaws, with the legs dangling free in space).

Also known from Apinae is the habit of gathering floral oils instead of pollen for use as a larval food; this behavior is otherwise known only from a few lineages in the family Melittidae.

This same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasps, where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors. The oldest non-compression bee fossil is found in New Jersey amber, ''Cretotrigona prisca'', a corbiculate bee of Cretaceous age (~65 mya). A fossil from the early Cretaceous (~100 mya), ''Melittosphex burmensis'', was initially considered "an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea sister to the modern bees", but subsequent research has rejected the claim that ''Melittosphex'' is a bee, or even a member of the superfamily Apoidea to which bees belong, instead treating the lineage as ''incertae sedis'' within the Aculeata. By the Eocene (~45 Mya) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages.The highly eusocial corbiculate Apidae appeared roughly 87 Mya, and the Allodapini (within the Apidae) around 53 Mya. The Colletidae appear as fossils only from the late Oligocene (~25 Mya) to early Miocene. The Melittidae are known from ''Palaeomacropis eocenicus'' in the Early Eocene. The Megachilidae are known from trace fossils (characteristic leaf cuttings) from the Middle Eocene. The Andrenidae are known from the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, around 34 Mya, of the Florissant shale. The Halictidae first appear in the Early Eocene with species found in amber. The Stenotritidae are known from fossil brood cells of Pleistocene age.

== Morphology ==
bees differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (hairs), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in limb structure, and the venation of the hind wings; and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.

Bees have the following characteristics:

* A pair of large compound eyes which cover much of the surface of the head. Between and above these are three small simple eyes (ocelli) which provide information on light intensity.
* The antennae usually have 13 segments in males and 12 in females, and are geniculate, having an elbow joint part way along. They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors), smell and taste; and small, hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to "hear" sounds.
* The mouthparts are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandibles and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar.
* The thorax has three segments, each with a pair of robust legs, and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight, and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing.
* The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.

== [[Honey bee|Honey bees]] ==
A '''honey bee''' (or '''honeybee''') is any bee member of the genus ''Apis'', primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies, though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000[ known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus Apis are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees is known as melittology. he genus name Apis is Latin for "bee". Although modern dictionaries may refer to Apis as either honey bee or honeybee, entomologist Robert Snodgrass explains that correct usage is to use two words, i.e. honey bee, as it is a kind or type of bee, whereas it is incorrect to run the two words together as in dragonfly or butterfly, because the latter are not flies.[4] Honey bee, not honeybee, is the listed common name in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, the Entomological Society of America Common Names of Insects Database, and the Tree of Life Web Project.

Unlike their look-alikes, [[bee]]s, wasps can sting a variety of times, while a bee can only sting once, and then will die. There are many families of wasps, and they belong to the [[Hymenoptera]] [[order]].

== Appearance ==
Wasps are usually yellow and black, but many species are just black or metallic. Some even have orange splotches and hairs. A wasp has two wings and an [[ovipositor]], which could possibly be long in some species. Certain species may also have long [[antenna]]e. A wasp's size may be between 1/128 inches to 2 1/2 inches.

== Life ==
Unlike a bee, a [http://deadliestinsect.hubpages.com/hub/Deadliest-Insects wasp] can go solo and usually doesn't look for honey for a colony. Wasps are known to be agressive and will lay their [[egg]]s practically anywhere. The [[larva]]e will eat whatever their parents eat. After their [[pupa]]l stage, the pupa will become a mature wasp.

== Defense ==
Usually a wasp is brightly colored to warn predators it is not tasty or will harm them, but some species are fully black or metallic, so foolish predators will find them as an easy meal. Stinging is actually their primary attack.

== Feeding habits ==
Since their are so many species of wasps, there are also many [[:Category:Feeding habits|feeding habits]] they can have, and practically all the feeding habits are used by wasps.

== Geography ==
Wasps are known worldwide, except in very cold regions.

== Pests ==
Certain species and families of wasps have been known to be pests, but most species have been known to kill pests.

==Nomenclature==
The term "cuckoo wasp" refers to the cuckoo-like way in which wasps in the family lay eggs in the nests of unrelated host species.[1]

Chrysididae, the scientific name of the family, refers to their shiny bodies and is derived from Greek chrysis, chrysid-, "gold vessel, gold-embroidered dress", plus the familial suffix -idae. The common names of many species pay similar tribute to their appearance: jewel wasp, gold wasp, emerald wasp, ruby wasp and so on (cf. French guêpe de feu, fire-wasp, and German Goldwespe, gold-wasp).
==Ecology and behavior==
Members of the largest subfamily, Chrysidinae, are the most familiar; they are generally kleptoparasites, laying their eggs in host nests, where their larvae consume the host egg or larva while it is still young, then the food provided by the host for its own juvenile. Chrysidines are distinguished from the members of other subfamilies in that most have flattened or concave lower abdomens and can curl into a defensive ball when attacked by a potential host, in the manner of a pill bug.[1] Members of the other subfamilies are parasitoids, of either sawflies or walking sticks, and cannot fold up into a ball.

Chrysidids are always solitary, and are closely associated with other solitary wasps. They fly mainly in the hottest and driest months of summer, preferring subtropical and Mediterranean climates. They favor dry areas and sandy soils; each species is confined to a narrow type of microhabitat where adults may rest or find hosts to parasitize, for example on bare soil or on dead wood where other solitary wasps have their nest holes. Some species visit flowers such as of the Umbelliferae, Compositae and Euphorbiae.

      <text bytes="3748" sha1="ojp7myxhmliittq3zxsncw4no9xrqp1" xml:space="preserve">[[File:Placeholder|right|300px|link=Special:FilePath/Placeholder]]The '''Mutillidae''' are a family of more than 3,000 species of [[wasp]]s (despite the names) whose wingless females resemble large, hairy [[ant]]s. Their common name velvet ant refers to their dense pile of hair, which most often is bright scarlet or orange, but may also be black, white, silver, or gold. Black and white specimens are sometimes known as panda ants due to their hair coloration resembling that of the giant panda. Their bright colors serve as aposematic signals. They are known for their extremely painful stings, hence the common name cow killer or cow ant. Unlike real ants, they do not have drones, workers, and queens. However, velvet ants do exhibit haplodiploid sex determination similar to other members of the [[Hymenoptera]], including the Vespoidea.
==Description==
The exoskeleton of all velvet ants is unusually tough (to the point that some entomologists have reported difficulty piercing them with steel pins when attempting to mount them for display in cabinets). This characteristic allows them to successfully invade the nests of their prey and also helps them retain moisture. Like related families in the Vespoidea, males have wings, but females uniformly are wingless. They exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. The males and females are distinct enough in their morphology, often making it very hard to decide whether or not a given male and female belong to the same species, unless they are captured while mating. In a few species, the male carries the smaller female aloft while mating, which is also seen in the related family Tiphiidae.
==Behavior==
Mature mutillids feed on nectar. Although some species are strictly nocturnal, females are often active during the day. Females of ''Tricholabiodes thisbe'' are sometimes active up to two hours before sunset. Guido Nonveiller (1963) hypothesized the Mutillidae are generally stenothermic and thermophilic; they may not avoid light, but rather are active during temperatures that usually occur only after sunset.

=== Defense mechanism ===
Predation is one of the strongest forces natural selection uses to drive the evolution of an organism’s morphology, physiology, and behavior. During this coevolution, the prey either being consumed by the predator or escaping has resulted in a plethora of impressive defensive strategies in prey species to improve the likelihood of escape. Velvet ants avoid predation using the following defense mechanisms; a venomous sting (if female), aposematic coloration, a stridulatory organ in their abdomen, an alarm secretion from their mandibular gland, and a durable exoskeleton. This array of defenses has contributed to the velvet ants being attributed the title of "the indestructible insect." This title was given to the velvet ants after experimental experiments of interactions between velvet ants and their potential predators that resulted in the survival of the ant and the ultimate avoidance by the predator. 

==Life cycle==
Male mutillids fly in search of females; after mating, the female enters a host insect nest, typically a ground-nesting bee or wasp burrow, and deposits one egg near each larva or pupa. Only a few species are known to parasitize other types of hosts; exceptions include the European velvet ant, ''Mutilla europaea'', one of the only species that attacks social bees (e.g., ''Bombus''), and the genus ''Pappognatha'', whose hosts are tree-dwelling orchid bees. The mutillid larvae then develop as idiobiont ectoparasitoids, eventually killing their immobile larval/pupal hosts within a week or two. Velvet ants exhibit haplodiploid sex determination, as do other members of the superfamily Vespoidea.

Another wasp close to polistes carolina is Polistes Perplexus, wich is another red colored wasp.

The perplexus has a more darker color then carolina, but their size and black colored wings are the same.

Polistes carolina males have curled antennae like all other polistes wasps, and a pale yellow face.

Males mate in the fall and new queens are prepared to hibernate.

An infertal female is a virgin that didn't mate and all ofspring will be male.

Male carolina wasps are born in fall and none in the spring.

'''Alderflies''' are megalopteran insects of the family Sialidae. They are closely related to the [[dobsonflies]] and [[fishflies]] as well as to the prehistoric Euchauliodidae. All living alderflies—about 66 species altogether[1]—are part of the subfamily Sialinae, which contains between one and seven extant genera according to different scientists' views. But in most classifications, all or almost all of these are treated as subgenera of ''Sialis''.
==Description==
Sialinae have a body length of less than 25 mm (1 inch), long filamentous antennae and four large, dark wings of which the anterior pair is slightly longer than the posterior. They lack ocelli and their fourth tarsal segment is dilated and deeply bilobed. Dead alderfly larvae are used as bait in fishing.
==Life cycle==
The females lay a vast number of eggs upon grass stems near water. When the larvae are born they drop into the water or the ground nearby it and make their way into their new aquatic biome. The larvae are aquatic, active, armed with strong sharp mandibles, and breathe by means of seven pairs of abdominal branchial filaments. When full sized, which takes between one and two years, they leave the water and spend a quiescent pupal stage on the land before metamorphosis into the sexually mature insect. Adult alderflies stay near to the water, in which they had lived in when they were younger. Once in their adult stage, they tend to only live 2 to 3 weeks, which they mainly use to reproduce.

      <text bytes="6105" sha1="m9arvfmiz7cio2oej1k9pnowa7uk2lz" xml:space="preserve">[[File:Placeholder|right|300px]]The '''Tachinidae''' are a large and variable family of true flies within the insect order [[Diptera]], with more than 8,200 known species and many more to be discovered. Over 1300 species have been described in North America alone. Insects in this family commonly are called '''tachina flies''' or simply '''tachinids'''. As far as is known, they all are protelean parasitoids, or occasionally parasites, of arthropods.
==Occurrence==
The family is cosmopolitan. Species occur in many habitats in many regions, including Neotropical, Nearctic,[2] Afrotropical,[3] Palaearctic, Oriental, Australasian and Oceanic.
===Life cycle===
Reproductive strategies vary greatly between Tachinid species, largely, but not always clearly, according to their respective life cycles. This means that they tend to be generalists rather than specialists. Comparatively few are restricted to a single host species, so there is little tendency towards the close co-evolution one finds in the adaptations of many specialist species to their hosts, such as are typical of protelean parasitoids among the Hymenoptera.

Larvae (maggots) of most members of this family are parasitoids (developing inside a living host, ultimately killing it). In contrast a few are parasitic (not generally killing the host). Tachinid larvae feed on the host tissues, either after having been injected into the host by the parent, or penetrating the host from outside. Various species have different modes of oviposition and of host invasion. Typically, Tachinid larvae are endoparasites (internal parasites) of caterpillars of butterflies and moths, or the eruciform larvae of sawflies, but some species attack adult beetles and some attack beetle larvae. Others attack various types of true bugs, and others attack grasshoppers; a few even attack centipedes.
===Oviposition and ovoviviparity===
Probably the majority of female Tachinids lay white, ovoid eggs with flat undersides onto the skin of the host insect. Imms[4] mentions the genera ''[[Gymnosoma]]''', ''Thrixion'', ''Winthemia'', and ''Eutachina'' as examples. In a closely related strategy some genera are effectively ovoviviparous (some authorities prefer the term ovolarviparous[2]) and deposit a hatching larva onto the host. The free larvae immediately bore into the host's body. illustrative genera include: ''[[Exorista]]'', ''[[Voria]]'', and ''[[Plagia]]''. Many Tachinid eggs hatch quickly, having partly developed inside the mother's uterus, which is long and often coiled for retaining developing eggs. However, it is suggested that the primitive state probably is to stick unembryonated eggs to the surface of the host.[2]

Many other species inject eggs into the host's body, using the extensible, penetrating part of their ovipositor, sometimes called the oviscapt, which literally means something like "egg digger". Species in the genera ''Ocyptera'', ''[[Alophora]]'', and ''[[Compsilura]]'' are examples.

Usually only one egg is laid on or in any individual host, and accordingly such an egg tends to be large, as is typical for eggs laid in small numbers. They are large enough to be clearly visible if stuck onto the outside of the host, and they generally are so firmly stuck that eggs cannot be removed from the skin of the host without killing them.

Yet another strategy of oviposition among some Tachinidae is to lay large numbers of small, darkly colored eggs on the food plants of the host species. ''Sturmia'', ''Zenillia'', and ''[[Gonia]]'' are such genera.

Many Tachinids are important natural enemies of major insect pests, and some species actually are used in biological pest control; for example, many species of Tachinid flies have been introduced into North America from their native lands as biocontrols to suppress populations of alien pests.[citation needed] Conversely, certain tachinid flies that prey on useful insects are themselves considered as pests; they can present troublesome problems in the sericulture industry by attacking silkworm larvae. One particularly notorious silkworm pest is the Uzi fly (''[[Exorista bombycis]]'').

Another reproductive strategy is to leave the eggs in the host's environment, for example the female might lay on leaves, where the host is likely to ingest them. Some tachinids that are parasitoids of stem-boring caterpillars deposit eggs outside the host's burrow, letting the first instar larvae do the work of finding the host for themselves. In other species, the maggots use an ambush technique, waiting for the host to pass and then attacking it and burrowing into its body.

Adult Tachinids are not parasitic, but either do not feed at all or visit flowers, decaying matter, or similar sources of energy to sustain themselves until they have concluded their procreative activities. Their non-parasitic behavior after eclosion from the pupa is what justifies the application of the term "protelean".
==Description==
Tachinid flies are extremely varied in appearance. Some adult flies may be brilliantly colored and then resemble blow-flies (family Calliphoridae). Most however are rather drab, some resembling house flies. However, Tachinid flies commonly are more bristly and more robust. Also, they usually have a characteristic appearance. They have three-segmented antennae, a diagnostically prominent postscutellum bulging beneath the scutellum (a segment of the mesonotum). They are aristate flies, and the arista usually is bare, though sometimes plumose. The calypters (small flaps above the halteres) are usually very large. Their fourth long vein bends away sharply.

Adult flies feed on flowers and nectar from aphids and scale insects. As many species typically feed on pollen, they can be important pollinators of some plants, especially at higher elevations in mountains where bees are relatively few.

The taxonomy of this family presents many difficulties. It is largely based on morphological characters of the adult flies, but also on reproductive habits and on the immature stage.

The family is distinguished from most other flies by the possession of "eyestalks": projections from the sides of the head with the eyes at the end. Some fly species from other families such as Drosophilidae, Platystomatidae, Richardiidae, and Tephritidae have similar heads, but the unique character of the Diopsidae is that their antennae are located on the stalk, rather than in the middle of the head as in all other flies.

The stalk-eyed flies are up to a centimeter long, and they feed on both decaying plants and animals. Their unique morphology has inspired research into how the attribute may have arisen through forces of sexual selection and natural selection. Studies of the behavior of the Diopsidae have yielded important insights into the development of sexual ornamentation, the genetic factors that maintain such a morphological feature, sexual selection, and the handicap principle.

==Distribution and habitat==
More than 100 species in the Diopsidae are known, with the greatest diversity found in the Old World tropics.[2] They are distributed throughout the region, with the best-known species being from Southeast Asia and Southern Africa. Also, two species in North America have been described and a European species has recently been found in Hungary.[3]

Adult diopsids are typically found on low-lying vegetation in humid areas, often near streams and rivers, where they feed on fungi and bacteria, which they scavenge from decaying vegetation. The larvae are saprophagic or phytophagous, eating decaying and fresh plant matter. ''[[Diopsis macrophthalma]]'' Dalman, 1817, is a pest of rice and sorghum in tropical Africa.

The peculiar morphology of stalk-eyed flies makes it easy to identify their fossils (e.g. in amber); one prehistoric genus that has been discovered in that form is Prosphyracephala.

==Morphology==
The Diopsidae are small to medium-sized flies, ranging from about 4.0 to about 12.0 mm in length. Their heads are subtriangular, with transverse eye stalks in all genera except the African genus Centrioncus. The head is usually sparsely haired, with vibrissae (whiskers) absent.[5]

The posterior portion of the fly's metathorax, or scutellum, has a pair of stout processes, and often the laterotergite (one of a number of lateral flanges) of the postnotum (a small dorsal sclerite on the insect thorax posterior to the notum) has a dome-like swelling or spine-like process. The anterior femora of the legs are stout, with ventral spines. Adult males have lost tergites seven and eight, and the seventh sternite forms a complete ventral band.[5]

Stalk-eyed flies, as the name implies, typically possess eyestalks. Their eyes are mounted on projections from the sides of the head, and the antennae are located on the eyestalks, unlike stalk-eyed flies from other families. A rather remarkable feature of stalk-eyed flies is their ability, shortly after they emerge from their pupae, to ingest air through their oral cavity and pump it through ducts in the head to the tips of the eye stalks, thereby elongating them while they are still soft and transparent

''Calliphora vomitoria'', also known as the '''bluebottle fly,''' or the '''Orange bearded blue bottle'''  is a [[blow fly]] belonging to the [[Calliphoridae]]  

family and the [[Diptera]] order. 

== Appearance ==
This species is 10-14 mm long, thus making it slightly larger than a housefly. The head and [[thorax]] are a dull gray color, and the abdomen is bright metallic blue with black markings. The body and [[leg]]s are covered with black bristle-like hair known as [[setae]]. The eyes are red and the wings are clear. The legs and antennae are black. The setae adorning it's entire body are sensory hairs that act as a set of "Feelers" that enable the fly to detect the presence of foods as the taste-sensory receptors are present on the underside of the legs. The abdomen is metallic and may often appear in a variety of shades due to the slight iridescent coating. The abdomen also has dark marking on it. The main distinctive feature from which the common name The orange bearded bluebottle is derived from are the orange setae covering the undersides of their heads close to the [[Insect anatomy|labellum]].

== Life cycle ==
The female bluebottle fly will lay her eggs in decaying leftover edible objects, garbage, and feces once mating as took place. The [[maggot]]s will feed on the place where the eggs were laid consuming the leftovers and feces, the maggots do not have any protective exoskeletons and are exposed to outer environments, the larva are pale with minute sized bulbous heads that are generally brown. The larva have ring-like segments which they use to move around by pushing their muscles forwards and contrasting them in order to move. After a few days, the [[larvae]] enters a pupal stage where they borrow within soil and manure the pupa is brown in color eventually after few days, A fully mature fly will emerge. After 2 or 3 weeks, the cycle will start over again. 

== senses ==
A bluebottle fly will feed off almost anything it can find, and can smell meat up to a distance of 7 kilometers away and have an extra sensory stimulus, The setae covering their bodies are receptors for taste as they also have pluvial organs on their feet (Taste receptors) , their eyes are composed of more than 10000 lenses whereas mammals like humans only have one lens in each eye.  

== Feeding ==
Like other blowflies, ''Calliphora vomitoria'' colonize animal remains, including humans. While adult ''Calliphora vomitoria'' feed on nectar, the larvae feed on corpses, the medium in which they grow. However, it has been shown that feeding on processed substrates (food that are modified for human consumption by increasing shelf life and taste through salting, curing, smoking, etc) provided much better growth than unprocessed substrates such as raw unmodified liver. Because different substrates drastically affected growth, ''C. vomitoria'' is best characterized as a specialist that best utilizes processed substrates (minced meats, for example). Its close relative, ''Calliphora vicina'', is a generalist, being able to utilize mixed substrates with equal growth rates. In the case of overcrowding, ''C. vomitoria'' competition results in compensation by increased speed of development, leading to smaller larvae and adults. This has complications in forensics because different parts of the body would grow at different rates.

== Pollination ==
This species of flies have been known to pollinate certain plants such as skunk cabbage, goldenrod and sunflowers, what allows them to do so is the presence of setae on their bodies that give a perfect place for pollen adhesion as pollen grains cling onto the setae and align in a lane like formation.

The '''Brachycera''' are a suborder of the order Diptera. It is a major suborder consisting of around 120 families. Their most distinguishing characteristic is reduced antenna segmentation.

== Description ==
A summary of the main physical characteristics is:

* Antenna size (with eight or fewer flagellomeres) is reduced.
* The maxillary palp (an elongated appendage near the mouth) has two segments or fewer.
* The back portions of the larval head capsule extend into the prothorax (the anterior part of the thorax, which bears the first pair of legs).
* Two distinct parts make up of the larval mandible (lower jaw).
* The epandrium and hypandrium of the genitalia are separated in males.
* No premandible is present on the lower surface of the labrum (the roof of the mouth).

Brachyceran flies can also be distinguished through behavior. Many of the species are predators or scavengers.

== Classification ==
The structure of subgroups within the Brachycera is a source of much confusion and controversy; many of the names used historically (e.g., Orthorrhapha) have not been used in decades, but still persist in textbooks, checklists, faunal catalogs, and other sources. Additionally, most recent classifications no longer use the Linnaean ranks for taxa (e.g., the Tree of Life Web Project), and this creates its own set of problems.

* [[Muscomorpha]]
* [[Stratiomyomorpha]]

== Overview ==
Most of which have been (or could be, or sometimes are) included within the Rhagionidae. The Tabanomorpha is one of the two Brachyceran groups outside the Hippoboscoidea that contain blood-feeding (hematophagous) species, though they are not important disease vectors.

== Behavior ==
The larvae of tabanomorphs are primarily found in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, and are predatory. They often have "warts" or other body projections that may resemble the prolegs of caterpillars.

== Classification ==
The infraorder Vermileonomorpha is often included within the Tabanomorpha, though the most recent classifications place them as its sister taxon. There are also some classifications that place the Nemestrinoidea within the Tabanomorpha, though this is not widely accepted. There are two superfamily-level lineages currently recognized within Tabanomorpha; the Tabanoidea and the Rhagionoidea (the latter comprising Austroleptidae, Bolbomyiidae, and Rhagionidae).

It includes fewer than 80 described species, most of them rare and with restricted distribution, in 10 genera. Historically the vermileonids had been regarded as belonging to the family Rhagionidae, possibly in a subfamily Vermileoninae. Their biology and morphology is so markedly distinct from the main Rhagionidae ''sensu stricto'' however, that the placement as a separate family has been widely accepted.

== Biology ==

=== Adult ===

==== Morphology ====
The adults are slender, fragile, long-legged flies, vaguely reminiscent of small crane flies. The adults generally visit flowers for nectar, but adults of some species may not feed at all. The mouthparts of the adult are hypognathous, used mainly for extracting nectar from flowers, long, and straight. This might have something to do with the common name "snipe-fly" for the family Rhagionidae, but it would be misleading to use that name for Vermileonidae now, as they are no longer included in the Rhagionidae, which still are called snipe-flies.

=== Distribution ===
Most vermileonid species are found in the drier regions of the western parts of Africa, from the Cape to Morocco, and also in the western parts of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly in Portugal.

=== Larvae ===

==== Predatory behavior ====
Pit traps of a larva of the wormlion ''Leptynoma sericea''; the outline of the larva on its back under the sand is faintly visible, in contrast to most pit-digging antlions The larvae of vermileonids are called '''wormlions''' which amounts to a direct translation of ''Vermileo''. They have evolved the same elaborate mechanism for trapping prey, as one sees in many species of the Neuropteran family Myrmeleontidae, the so-called "antlions"; that is, they make cone-shaped "pits" in sandy areas and feed on insects that fall into the pits. The mechanism is elegant in that in both groups of insects, the larva creates the pit by flinging particles out. Much of the material falls back, coming to rest at effectively the critical angle of repose. This is a good example for convergent evolution. Thus, when a small insect, commonly an ant, blunders into the pit, its weight causes the sand to collapse below it, drawing the victim toward the center, where the larva lies in wait under a thin layer of loose sand. As soon as it is alerted by falling sand grains, the larva assists this process by vigorously flicking more sand out from the center of the pit. This undermines the pit walls and causes them to collapse toward the center. The sand that the larva now is flinging also pelts the prey with so much loose, rolling material as to prevent it from getting any foothold on the easier slopes that the initial collapse of the slope has presented. The combined effect is to bring the prey down to within grasp of the larva, which then can inject venom and digestive fluids.

==== Pit traps ====
Unlike the pit-digging Myrmeleontidae, vermileonid larvae do not travel round and round while digging the pit trap. Instead, they simply lie at the centre with the rear end buried, and dig their heads repeatedly forward into the sand, flinging it out by vigorously straightening their fore ends. In contrast with conical digging, this approach is believed to take longer since more sand is likely to fall back into the pit when throwing from the center. Finally, they cover themselves with a thin layer of sand while lying across the bottom of the cone. Wormlion larvae prefer shaded habitats over lit ones, fine sand of small particle size over coarser sand, and obstacle free soil. All these factors enable them to construct large pits. Unfavorable conditions lead to more frequent relocation of the pits.

==== Predators ====
The main enemies of the larvae of either antlions or wormlions are ground-hunting birds such as hoopoes and gallinaceous birds that learn to recognise their pits and probe or scratch them from the sand. If alarmed by such activity, the wormlion larva retracts abruptly into an S-shape under the sand, and if dug out, it retains that shape, not having much option for an alternative strategy at its disposal. Actually, because its skin is coated with sand, and it is very small, it is very easy to overlook while it lies still. However, if it is sufficiently teased after being dug out, it may begin to lash about powerfully, flinging itself away with enough force to escape its tormentor. It does not, however, hook its mouthparts into its hinder end to achieve an efficient leap such as some fruit fly and carrion fly larvae do.

==== Distribution ====
Like antlion larvae, vermileonid larvae are primarily found in sandy habitats, often semi-deserts, usually in the shelter of rocks or bushes, and they are voracious predators.

== Classification ==
The infraorder Vermileonomorpha is often included within the Tabanomorpha, though the most recent classifications place them as its sister taxon.

'''Archisargoidea''' is an extinct superfamily of brachyceran flies known from the late Middle Jurassic (Callovian) to early Late Cretaceous (Turonian). 
==Morphology==
Most flies in the superfamily have large eyes and an elongated abdomen, preserved females have a sharp, piercing oviscapt used for injecting eggs into host matter. Their relationships with other members of Brachycera is controversial, 

== Analysis ==
they are usually considered close relatives of either Stratiomyomorpha or Muscomorpha. Internal relationships between the families are uncertain and the topology of the only cladistic analysis of the family was weakly supported.

      <text bytes="2095" sha1="mr6depcnxsp8e93kawoe2l5y78c2er4" xml:space="preserve">The Brachyceran infraorder '''Muscomorpha''' is a large and diverse group of flies, containing the bulk of the Brachycera, and, most of the known flies. It includes a number of the most familiar flies, such as the housefly, the fruit fly, and the blow fly. The antennae are short, usually three-segmented, with a dorsal arista. Their bodies are often highly setose, and the pattern of setae is often taxonomically important.

== Metamorphosis ==
The larvae of muscomorphs (in the sense the name is used here; see below) have reduced head capsules, and the pupae are formed inside the exoskeleton of the last larval instar; exit from this puparium is by a circular line of weakness, and this pupal type is called "cyclorrhaphous"; this feature gives this group of flies their traditional name, Cyclorrhapha.

== Classification ==
The name Cyclorrhapha is used, in various modern classifications, to represent either a subgroup within the infraorder Muscomorpha, or simply a rankless group within the Brachycera. In either case, the Empidoidea are the sister taxon to the Cyclorrhapha. In the present classification, as the term Muscomorpha is used to refer to the sister taxon of the Empidoidea, the names "Muscomorpha" and "Cyclorrhapha" are effectively synonymous (though not entirely interchangeable: for nomenclatural purposes, it is always considered better if the endings of names of similar rank are consistent, and since all the other infraordinal names end in "-morpha", the use of "Cyclorrhapha" as an infraordinal name would be inconsistent)

he Brachyceran infraorder '''Asilomorpha''' is a large and diverse group of flies, containing the bulk of the nonmuscoid Brachycera. The larvae of asilomorphs are extremely diverse in habits, as well.

== Classification ==
In most modern classifications, the infraorder Asilomorpha is not recognized, as it is paraphyletic; the Empidoidea are the sister taxon to the Muscomorpha (used here in the same sense as the traditional Cyclorrhapha, not following the Tree of Life Web Project system in this one instance). However, these modern classifications are not Linnaean, and - while relatively easy to visualize on a phylogenetic tree diagram - do not lend themselves to any classification that uses Linnaean ranks . Also, some classifications place the Nemestrinoidea within the Tabanomorpha, though this is not widely accepted.

Acroceridae is a small family in order [[Diptera]] which compromises lesser-studied insects known as '''Balloon Flies''' and are commonly known as '''Spider Flies, Small-Headed Flies''' and '''Hump-backed Flies.'''

== Morphology ==
Balloon flies are odd-looking rare insects, they have large swollen abdomens that have a unique hump-shaped uplifted mass. They have fairly small-sized heads, most of the proportion of the head is taken by the large, bulging [[Compound eye|faceted eyes]]. They have long (In-comparison to their body length) wings that measure approximately 25 mm along with small legs, most species have setae-covered bodies but lack major bristles, some species have latitudinal black hairy lines as only applied for batesian mimics of honey bees and wasps. They have rounded, globular abdomen that resembles a balloon (Hence their common name) The tarsi are adorned with whetted, sharp claws. Their larvae are known as [[planidium]] and have a flattened, slender wide bodies covered with plates with a [[cerci]] at the bottom. They also have exeptionally long proboscis probably for scooping out nectar from plants such as honeysuckle and trumpet lilies. 

== Ecology ==

=== Feeding Habits ===
Members from the family Acroceridae are [[nectarivores]]. The larvae are [[Parasitism|parasitoids]] in a wide range of [[Spider|Aranea species]]. They spend their lives inside a live host slowly weakening the host and eventually leading to the host's death, the dead host is consumed from the inside-out then the parasite pupates outside the host.

== Metamorphosis ==
members of the family undergo a type of metamorphosis known as hypermetamorphosis, The larvae is a planidium the adults do not seek their host instead the larvae does, the larvae can leap several millimeters into the air into to find it's host and flee from attackers. The larvae will enter the pupation period outside of the host's body pupation may take several years to reach completion.

== Geographical Range ==

=== Distribution ===
They have a cosmopolitan geographical distribution however they aren't abundant in numbers compared to other cosmopolitan dipterans. 

=== Habitat ===
Members from this family occur worldwide in semi-arid tropical areas they might are possibly found in rainforests, lush densely-foliaged woods and sunny grasslands.

== Taxonomic Division ==

''Erythemis simplicicollis'', Also known as the '''eastern pondhawk''' and more formerly, The '''common pondhawk''', is a species of pond 

[[Anisoptera|dragonfly]] from the [[Libellulidae]]. 

== Morphology ==
A medium sized-dragonfly with an approximate body length of 36 mm with an average wingspan being 43 mm in length, They are fairly common is slow-moving ponds, lakes, rivers and streams. The males are vibrant blue in color with a turquoise colored thorax and faint black rings on abdomen, the females are bright green in color with darker and more clearly visible blotches and rings present on the [[abdomen]], both genders have one common physical trait being their lovely iridescently colored metallic green [[Compound eye|eyes]].

=== Larva ===
The [[Naiad|larva]] are dull-olive green color with vibrant green compound. Eyes upon reaching the point at which they can [[Molting|molt]], the early [[Adult|adults]] are dull olive in color. The larval stage of this energetic flyer is just as ferocious as the adults.

== Behavior ==
''Erythemis simplicicollis'' is truly an energetic and powerful hunter, It's agility allows only a few skilled preys to escape this furious hunter. They are widespread.The males are vastly territorial and will chase away anything that dares enter their domain. The females tend to lay [[Egg|eggs]] in safe and shallow water with an ample [[Culex|food source]]. The Eastern pond hawk is a vibrant species which sparks up the life in water bodies while serving as an important part of the aquatic food chain both as a juvenile and an adult Anisopteran. 

== Distribution ==
The eastern pondhawk is native to parts of North America and Central America. Its range includes the rivers of Ontario and Quebec in Canada, much of the eastern United States, the Bahamas, the West Indies, Mexico and Central America as far south as Costa Rica. It is a widespread and abundant species.

A '''damselfly''' is an [[insect]] belonging to the [[Odonata]] [[order]] that resembles a [[Anisoptera|dragonfly]] in many ways. Zygoptera itself is an [[infraorder]] from the order [[Odonata]] with more than 5000 described species. 

The main difference between damselflies and dragonflies is that a damselfly has a thinner [[abdomen]] and they are usually smaller, they tend to have a weak-fluttering flight unlike dragonflies and keep their wings closed at rest (Excluding spreadwing damselflies) 

Damselflies are also weaker fliers than dragonflies, dragonflies tend to hover in mid-air swooping down at any unlucky dipteran that gets into it's way.

== Biology: ==

=== Morphology ===
Coming in a wide array of iridescent and stunning coloration, these delicate-winged flyers are carnivorous insects that dwell within shallow lakes and streams of water as a [[Naiad|juvenile]] and flying high in the tropical forests and fluttering across flower meadows, damselflies are surely a beautiful sight. Unlike dragonflies, damselflies have an [[ocelli]] (Light-sensory organ) on their head (although absent in a few species) and thin abdomens painted with natural pigmentations. These fragile insects have highly flexible [[Mandible|jaws]] and an cylindrical head along with the [[Thorax|thoracic region]] lift slightly upwards connecting the [[Insect terminology|wings]] and the thin [[abdomen]]. Their eyes cover an enormous portion of their heads similar to dragonflies, 70% of a damselflies' brain is dedicated to it's sight! 

=== Metamorphosis ===
Damselflies are '''''hemmimatabolous''','' meaning they undergo [[metamorphosis|incomplete metamorphosis]] and have an aquatic nymphal stage. The female will lay her [[egg]]s in water or high in trees. Once the eggs hatch, the [[naiad]] will search in the water for [[daphnia]] (mosquito [[larva|larvae]]) and eat them. After the final nymphal stage, the [[naiad]] becomes mature and will then eat [[fly|flies]] and [[mosquito]]es on the surface. they've also been known to feed on other soft-bodied insects namely [[Aphid|aphids]]. Some larger tropical species will also consume other arthropods such as [[spider]]s. 

== Behavior ==

=== Mating ===
Mating in damselflies, as in dragonflies, is a complex, precisely choreographed process involving both indirect insemination and delayed fertilisation. The male first has to attract a female to his territory, continually driving off rival males. When he is ready to mate, he transfers a packet of sperm from his primary genital opening on segment 9, near the end of his abdomen, to his secondary genitalia on segments 2–3, near the base of his abdomen. The male then grasps the female by the head with the claspers at the end of his abdomen; the structure of the claspers varies between species, and may help to prevent interspecific mating. The pair fly in tandem with the male in front, typically perching on a twig or plant stem. The female then curls her abdomen downwards and forwards under her body to pick up the sperm from the male's secondary genitalia, while the male uses his "tail" claspers to grip the female behind the head: this distinctive posture is called the "heart" or "wheel"; the pair may also be described as being "in cop".

== Trivia ==

* Damselflies along with their counterparts dragonflies have been existing on earth since 300 million years.
* Even after possessing 3 pairs of legs, they are unable to walk.
* Damselflies can be found on 6 continents (With the excluded continent being Antarctica)
* Both males and females in every species possess 10 segments in their abdomen this is to help form the coupulatry wheel during the process of mating.
* Female damselflies take a dive into the shallow waters to lay eggs!

Anisoptera,  (from Greek ἄνισος ''anisos'', "unequal" and πτερόν ''pteron'', "wing", because the hindwing is broader than the forewing) Is the

superfamily which compromises of dragonflies from the order [[Odonata]] and the suborder [[Epiprocta]] pairing up with it's counterpart damselflies ([[Zygoptera]]) It contains about 3000 extanct species known by [[entomologist]].

== Morphology ==
[[File:Erythemis simplicicollis.jpg|thumb|254x254px|[[Erythemis simplicicollis]] (Eastern pondhawk)]]
Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying insects that hold their wings horizontally both in flight and at rest. By contrast, [[Zygoptera|damselflies]] (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the [[abdomen]] when stationary, and the eyes are well separated on the sides of the head. An adult dragonfly has three distinct segments, the head, [[thorax]], and abdomen, as in all insects. It has a chitinous [[exoskeleton]] of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short [[Antenna|antennae]]. It is dominated by the two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species.  The [[Compound eye|compound eyes]] meet at the top of the head (except in the [[Petaluridae]] and [[Gomphidae]], as also in the genus ''[[Epiophlebia]]''). Also, they have three simple eyes or [[Ocellus|ocelli]]. The [[Mandible|mouthparts]] are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like [[Insect terminology|labrum]], at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight. The thorax consists of three segments as in all insects. The [[Insect anatomy|prothorax]] is small and is flattened dorsally into a shield-like disc, which has two transverse ridges. The [[Insect anatomy|mesothorax]] and [[Insect anatomy|metathorax]] are fused into a rigid, box-like structure with internal bracing, and provide a robust attachment for the powerful wing muscles inside. The thorax bears two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. The wings are long, veined, and membranous, narrower at the tip and wider at the base. The hindwings are broader than the forewings and the venation is different at the base. The veins carry haemolymph, which is analogous to blood in vertebrates, and carries out many similar functions, but which also serves a hydraulic function to expand the body between [[Nymph|nymphal stages]] (instars) and to expand and stiffen the wings after the [[adult]] emerges from the final nymphal stage. The leading edge of each wing has a node where other veins join the marginal vein, and the wing is able to flex at this point. In most large species of dragonflies, the wings of females are shorter and broader than those of males. The legs are rarely used for walking, but are used to catch and hold prey, for perching, and for climbing on plants. Each has two short basal joints, two long joints, and a three-jointed foot, armed with a pair of claws. The long leg joints bear rows of spines, and in males, one row of spines on each front leg is modified to form an "eyebrush", for cleaning the surface of the [[compound eye]].

== Behavior ==
Many dragonflies, particularly males, are territorial. Some defend a territory against others of their own species, some against other species of dragonfly and a few against insects in unrelated groups. A particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground; males of many species such as the ''[[Pachydiplax longipennis]]'' (blue dasher) jostle other dragonflies to maintain the right to alight there. Defending a breeding territory is common among male dragonflies, especially in species that congregate around ponds. The territory contains desirable features such as a sunlit stretch of shallow water, a special plant species, or the preferred substrate for egg-laying. The territory may be small or large, depending on its quality, the time of day, and the number of competitors, and may be held for a few minutes or several hours. Dragonflies including ''[[Tramea lacerata]]'' (black saddlebags) may notice landmarks that assist in defining the boundaries of the territory. Landmarks may reduce the costs of territory establishment, or might serve as a spatial reference. Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face, abdomen, legs, or wings. The ''Plathemis lydia'' ([[common whitetail]]) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag. Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high-speed chases. A female must mate with the territory holder before laying her eggs. There is also conflict between the males and females. Females may sometimes be harassed by males to the extent that it affects their normal activities including foraging and in some dimorphic species females have evolved multiple forms with some forms appearing deceptively like males. In some species females have evolved behavioural responses such as feigning death to escape the attention of males. Similarly, selection of habitat by adult dragonflies is not random, and terrestrial habitat patches may be held for up to 3 months. A species tightly linked to its birth site utilises a foraging area that is several orders of magnitude larger than the birth site.

===[[Metamorphosis]]===

==== Mating ====
Mating in dragonflies is a complex, precisely choreographed process. First, the male has to attract a female to his territory, continually driving off rival males. When he is ready to mate, he transfers a packet of sperm from his primary genital opening on segment 9, near the end of his abdomen, to his secondary genitalia on segments 2–3, near the base of his abdomen. The male then grasps the female by the head with the claspers at the end of his abdomen; the structure of the claspers varies between species, and may help to prevent interspecific mating. The pair flies in tandem with the male in front, typically perching on a twig or plant stem. The female then curls her abdomen downwards and forwards under her body to pick up the sperm from the male's secondary genitalia, while the male uses his "tail" claspers to grip the female behind the head: this distinctive posture is called the "heart" or "wheel"; the pair may also be described as being "in cop"

====[[Naiad|Nymphs]]====
[[File:Dragonfly naiad.jpg|thumb|270x270px]]
The nymph stage of dragonflies lasts up to five years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to metamorphose into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its [[Spiracles|respiration system]] adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its nymph skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent. Dragonflies in temperate areas can be categorized into two groups, an early group and a later one. In any one area, individuals of a particular "spring species" emerge within a few days of each other. The springtime darner (''Basiaeschna janata''), for example, is suddenly very common in the spring, but disappears a few weeks later and is not seen again until the following year. By contrast, a "summer species" emerges over a period of weeks or months, later in the year. They may be seen on the wing for several months, but this may represent a whole series of individuals, with new adults hatching out as earlier ones complete their lifespans.

=== Flight ===
Dragonflies are powerful and agile fliers, capable of migrating across the sea, moving in any direction, and changing direction suddenly. In flight, the adult dragonfly can propel itself in six directions: upward, downward, forward, backward, to left and to right. They have four different styles of flight: A number of flying modes are used that include counter-stroking, with forewings beating 180° out of phase with the hindwings, is used for hovering and slow flight. This style is efficient and generates a large amount of lift; phased-stroking, with the hindwings beating 90° ahead of the forewings, is used for fast flight.

== Trivia ==

* Old and unreliable claims are made that dragonflies such as the southern giant darner can fly up to 97 km/h (60 mph). However, the greatest reliable flight speed records are for other types of insects.
* large dragonflies like the hawkers have a maximum speed of 36–54 km/h (22–34 mph) with average cruising speed of about 16 km/h (9.9 mph).
* Dragonflies can travel at 100 body-lengths per second in forward flight, and three lengths per second backwards.
* Dragonflies see faster than we do, they see around 200 images per second. A dragonfly can see in 360 degrees, and nearly 80 percent of the insect's brain is dedicated to its sight.

==Antlion==
Antlions are part of the Myrmeleontidae family and their likely genus is Myrmeleo. Antlion adults are sometimes called antlion lacewings. Antlion larva are often called a doodlebug, because of the tracks that the larva leave. The tracks are somewhat spiral-shaped and look as if someone "doodled' on the sand, hence the name doodlebug.[[File:Spider.jpg|thumb|A fully grown antlion.]]

Lacewings are small winged members of the Chrysopidae family of the order Neuroptera. '''lacewing''', (order Neuroptera), any of a group of insects that are characterized by a complex network of wing veins that give them a lacy appearance.

== Morphology ==
The most common lacewings are in the green lacewing family, Chrysopidae, and the brown lacewing family, Hemerobiidae. The green lacewing, sometimes known as the golden-eyed lacewing, has long delicate antennae, a slender greenish body, golden- or copper-coloured eyes, and two pairs of similar veined wings. It is worldwide in distribution and flies near grasses and shrubs. The lacewing is also known as a stinkfly because it emits a disagreeable odour as a protective device. The female green lacewing secretes slender stalks and deposits one egg on top of each stalk. This prevents the predatory larvae from devouring unhatched eggs. The larva, often called an aphidlion, has prominent sucking mouthparts and well-developed legs. These capture and drain body fluids from aphids and other soft-bodied insects. After about two weeks of continuous feeding, the larva spins a silken, pearl-sized cocoon on the underside of a leaf and remains in the pupal case approximately two weeks before emerging as an adult. Adults are generally 1 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 inches) in length. The brown lacewing resembles the green lacewing but is smaller in size, brown in colour, may have dark spots on the wings, and does not secrete stalks for its eggs. Some lacewing larvae hold debris (including the bodies of their victims) on their backs with hooks or bristles. This camouflage allows the lacewing larva to surprise its victims and also protects it from enemies.

Notice how it looks similar to a mantis.]]Mantidflies are medium sized insects About 5–47 millimetres (0.2–1.9 in) long and with a wingspan of 5–30 mm (0.2–1.2 in) most are brownish with green, yellow and sometimes red hues, larva are often parastoids but are sometimes moble predators.

Mantispinae have the most specialized larval development among all mantidflies studied to date: their campodeiform larvae seek out female Spiders or their egg sacs which they then enter; the scarabaeiform larvae then feed on the spider eggs, draining egg contents through a piercing/sucking tube formed by modified mandibles and maxillae, pupating in the egg sac.

First-instar mantispids use two strategies to locate spider eggs: larvae may burrow directly through the silk of egg sacs they find, or they may board and be carried by female spiders prior to sac production entering the sac as it is being constructed. Mantispids that board spiders usually adopt positions on or near the base of the abdomen; some species may enter the spider's book lungs. Larvae maintain themselves aboard spiders by feeding on spider hemolymph. transfers of larvae from spider to spider are possible during spider mating or cannibalism. All of the major groups of hunting spiders are attacked by spider-boarding mantispids; the egg sacs of web-building species are also entered by egg-sac penetrators.

'''Owlflies''' are dragonfly-like insects with large bulging eyes and strongly knobbed antennae. They are neuropterans in the family Ascalaphidae; they are only distantly related to the true flies, and even more distant from the [[dragonflies]] and [[damselflies]]. They are diurnal or crepuscular predators of other flying insects, and are typically 5 cm (2.0 in) long.
==Description==
Owlflies are readily distinguished from dragonflies because the latter have short bristle-like antennae. The closely related antlions (family Myrmeleontidae) have short, weakly clubbed antennae, smaller eyes, and very different wing venation.[1] All but one species of Ascalaphidae have long antennae, easily distinguishing them; the sole exception is the Brazilian ''Albardia furcata'', the only living member of the subfamily Albardiinae, which has short antennae, but the club is very strong (compared to myrmeleontids) and its typical reticulate ascalaphid wing venation demonstrates its actual relationships.
==Ecology and life cycle==
Adult owlflies are aerial predators feeding on other insects. When disturbed, some owlflies release a strong, musk-like chemical to deter enemies. Adults of many New World species are most active at sunset and dawn and can often be collected around lights. During the day, such adults rest on stems and twigs with the body, legs, and antennae pressed to the stem. The abdomen in a few species is held up, projecting into the air, to look like a broken twig. Many Old World species, however, are most active during the day, and are brightly colored – many even hold their wings spread at rest like dragonflies; perhaps this is a form of mimicry to benefit from the fact that dragonflies are aggressive predators which smaller predatory insects (for which the average neuropteran would be prey) would be better to avoid. Most owlflies are about 2 inches in length.[2] Adult Ascalaphinae such as ''Ululodes'' have large divided eyes, which is where the common name "owlfly" came from,[2] in addition to their crepuscular habits. Owlflies are worldwide in distribution, though in North America they are primarily southerly.

Eggs are laid on twigs or under stones. Larvae are ambush predators, and lie on the ground or in vegetation, covered with debris, waiting for prey. Larvae resemble those of antlions, but have a "finger-like appendage" on the side of each segment. Some genera actively cement sand and debris onto their bodies as camouflage. Pupation occurs in a spheroidal silk cocoon in leaf litter or soil.

'''Neuroptera''' is the order of [[Antlion]] [[lacewing]]s, [[Raphidioptera|snake flies]] , [[Alderfly|alder flies]], [[Caddisfly|caddis flies]] and other winged insects, it consists of insects with one similarity and that is a pair of thin-finely membranous wings. he order consists of some 6,000 species. '''Neuroptera''' can be grouped together with the [[Megaloptera]] and [[Raphidioptera]] in the unranked taxon '''Neuropterida''' including: alderflies, [[fishflies]], [[Dobsonfly|dobsonflies]], and snakeflies. Adult Neuropterans have four membranous wings, all about the same size, with many veins. They have chewing mouth as for, they are predatory insects and mostly feed off smaller invertebrates.

== Behavior &amp; Biology ==
[[File:Green Lacewing.jpg|thumb|256x256px|[[Lacewing|Green Lacewing]]]]
These predatory insects have a pair of finely membranous wings used to maintain flight also known as "Net wings" they function in a typical way. Antlions have a greatly interesting behavior as a larva which is to dig in sand pits which is a trap for it's victims, smaller insects (mainly ants) will carelessly walk into the sand pits dug up the juvenile antlion and upon being sensed by the predator, the antlion will use it's large jaws to ensnare the prey into pieces. Some species of caddis flies as a juvenile use a fine tape-like secretions to build their own homes, the compositions of these portable homes normally consists of stones, these homes help the larva withstand extreme changes within the water current while providing a camouflage against larger predators such as salamanders and newts however this can only be seen in a few notable species of caddis flies. 

== Antlions ==
'''[[Antlion|Main source of information]].'''
[[File:Antlion.jpg|thumb|220x220px|[[antlion]] (juvenile)]]
Antlions are part of the Myrmeleontidae family and their likely genus is Myrmeleo. Antlion adults are sometimes called antlion lacewings. Antlion larva are often called a doodlebug, because of the tracks that the larva leave. The tracks are somewhat spiral-shaped and look as if someone "doodled' on the sand, hence the name doodlebug. Antlions got their name upon their predatory behaviors and their food source which primarily consists of ants. Their hunting methods are quite unique in particular during their juvenile stage of their life cycle. The larva of an antlions will dig in sand pits and cover itself with sand at the very bottom of it's own pit. When any small insects (notably ants) fall into these pits the hunter lying at the bottom of the pit awakens and ensnare it's prey in it's large mandibles that are only meant for hunting, this predatory behavior gave them their common name.

== [[Lacewing|Lacewings]] ==
[[File:Green Lacewing.jpg|thumb|1x1px|alt=]]
Lace wings are predatory flying insects that posses a pair of membranous net wings with a tinted shade casted over it They belong to the family Chrysopidae which compromises of 1300-2000 described species. Lacewings are predatory and mainly feed on aphids. They are called so due to the extremely thin venations on their wings that somewhat have a resemblance to a textile known as lace however this is to only help the lacewings camouflage within their surroundings. Due to their habit of feeding on aphids, lacewings are often considered to help the final outcome from crop harvests. Lacewings normally have a body length (including wingspan) of 7-30 mm the most interesting thing which makes lacewings so special is their habit of laying their eggs on large silky stalks that support the eggs until they hatch into larvae this may be a protection against ants.

== [[Dobsonfly|Dobsonflies]] ==
Not to be mistaken for [[Odonata|dragonflies]]. Dobsonflies are a subfamily of insects, Corydalinae, part of the Megalopteran family Corydalidae. The larvae are aquatic insects and are more likely to be seen inhabiting streams, ponds and lakes, the adults also prefer habitats closeby to freshwater lakes and rivers. The adults posses an enormous pair of curved pincer-like jaws that only males have, the females have smaller pair of pincers for no clear purpose as dobsonflies do not feed as an adult as for, after reaching maturity their main purpose is to reproduce as they only live for no longer than a few days as an adult. Dobsonflies are harmless to humans, as they do not cause any structural damage, bite or sting, or even transmit diseases. The females are able to bite, but these cases are very rare, and their bite has no lasting effects. Their larva has a physical appearance similar to that of a juvenile centipede. They will survive on the food they consumed as a larva and will eventually die as their energy they restored as a juvenile starts to wane away and vanish.

== [[Raphidioptera|Snakeflies]] ==
snakeflies is the sub-family of insects known as [[Raphidioptera]] which consists of nearly 251 species of insects, these insects feed on smaller insects such as aphids as a larva and upon reaching maturity they feed on soft-bodied insects and arthropods. These insects are called so due to their large "necks" their heads are supported by. Snakeflies are confined to arboreal habitats in the broadest sense, including all types of forests, with scattered shrubs In the northern temperate zones. Both the adults and the larva are predatory and feed on soft-bodied insects.

== [[Nemopteridae]] ==
[[File:Nemoptera.jpg|thumb|257x257px|Spoonwing]]
Nemopteridae is the order of spoonwings, there are less than 200 species of Nemopteridae they belong to the order [[Neuroptera]], they are sometimes known as thread tailed antlions and can be easily confused with swallowtail butterflies in flight. These insects have a large pair of vibrantly colored wings painted with pigmented scales and their hindwings morphed into a long-thread like structure that are normally larger in their size compared to the forewings. They can easily mistaken for a swallowtail butterfly in their flight motion due to their physical appearencce. They are predatory and feed on small-soft bodied insects. Spoonwings in the case of males posses a bullas located at the margin of the wings which used to release pheromones to attract mates

Spoonwings in the case of males posses a bulla located at the margin of the wings which used to release pheromones to attract mates They have a rather weak-fluttering flight and are often seen circling and moving in a chronological wave-like pattern. They can either be nocturnal or diurnal. They have two sub-families and in this article we're mentioning Nemopteridae which compromises of day-flying insects that can be found in a diverse range of habitats.

== Habitat ==
[[File:Nemopteridae.png|thumb|318x318px|Spoonwings]]
there can be a little confusion when we talk about habitat of these insects as they prefer a wide range of habitats the most common habitat included sunny large patches of meadows thriving with enough food to last for generations but some spoonwings prefer shrublands and deserts as a suitable habitat some spoonwings have even adapted themselves to their survival in urbanization. Although they are becoming quite rare which is due to loss of habitat in nature. They have a great liking for semi-arid or arid climatic conditions especially semi-arid regions scattered with shrubs and bushes (shrubland)

of diurnal moth Native to Northern America.

== Biology ==

=== Morphology ===
The sage brush sheep moth is a beautiful white moth with a wingspan of 71-93 mm.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemileuca_hera&lt;/ref&gt; The white wings have black markings on their subtle wings including a small black crescent on each wings alongsides black stripes. The moth has fluffy orange bodies with black and white markings present on the thorax. Males have feathery crimson antennae. 

=== Behaviour ===

==== Imago behaviour ====
Imagos do not feed and are diurnal by nature. Emergence from the occurs during early morning hours. The adults can be observed from July to September&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemileuca_hera&lt;/ref&gt; but varies depending on location. The adults are known to fly several meters above the ground and have an erratic flight patterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu/browse/family-saturniidae/subfamily-hemileucinae/hemileuca/hemileuca-hera/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Infant behaviour ====
Infants feed in groups when young, as they mature they tend to become more solitary in nature.&lt;ref&gt;http://pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu/browse/family-saturniidae/subfamily-hemileucinae/hemileuca/hemileuca-hera/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life cycle ===
The females lay their eggs on sagebrush plant in a ring shape&lt;ref&gt;https://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/species/Hemileuca-hera&lt;/ref&gt; on the surface of the leaves. The infants hatch during mid summers to mid late spring. The caterpillars build cocoons in mulch and leaf litter&lt;ref&gt;http://pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu/browse/family-saturniidae/subfamily-hemileucinae/hemileuca/hemileuca-hera/&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the emergence of adults during early springtime.

I bought 10 of these at a meeting for reptile fanciers, where they were sold as food insects. The box was marked ''blaberus fusca'' but I cannot independently confirm that this is correct. 

==Morphology==
The species apparently comes from South-America. The adults are winged, about 7 cm long, with a dark brown mark on the [[pronotum]], and shadowed places on the wings. The larvae are dark brown, with lighter markings, excellent at camouflaging among leaf litter. 

==temperature==
I keep them at 25-30 degrees celsius, at which they seem to thrive. Below 23 seems to be a slow death sentence for them - which is a good thing: if one of them should escape you don't want them in your kitchen. But to keep them you will need to heat the cage a bit. 

==food==
Cat pellets, oats, guppy food, and a bit of fresh food (piece of banana, piece of apple, changed every other day or when it seems dry or starts to get mouldy) keeps them happy. 

==water==
I take care that there is always some of water available but not in such a way that they could drown. An upside-down flask in a small petri dish.

==size of cage==
I use glass terrariums with doors that slide up (can't leave them open by accident) of 20x20x20 cm. A bit of sand or leaf litter on the floor and an egg carton for shelter. The do not climb against the glass and seem not to be able to fly despite their wings. One of these holds 5-8 animals comfortably. 

==humidity==
Misting with a plant spray gun once a day or every two days. In a very dry cage the moulting seems to give troubles occasionally: one emerging adult couldn't get out of its skin and several others who did, had underwings which did not fold properly under the top wings. 

==reproduction==
The first egg-case was noticed about 3-4 weeks after the first few adults emerged. It consists of about 40 long-ovoid eggs stuck together on their sides in two layers with a hard glue. The entire 'egg-stick' is about 1 inch long, 4 mm wide and 3 mm thick, and quite hard. Egg cases protrude a while  from the females' abdomen before they are laid. 

==behaviour==
Not very exciting. They take shelter in the dark, antennae waving about in all directions, and come out only to feed and moult. The can run but usually are quite careful, a few steps, short pause, another few steps. Antennae always on the move. Not aggressive, they do not bite and can easily be handled but the wriggling feet take a bit of nerve to keep hold of. 

==moulting==
Usually early in the evening. Recently moulted ones are quite white but turn tan in a few hours. The next morning they can be recognized only by a shinier skin than before. And they are shorter, broader and flatter. As they gain weight for the next moult they expand in the depth and length dimensions, the abdominal segments are pushed out like a telescope.

Formerly, the termites were considered a separate order, [[Isoptera]], but genetic and molecular evidence suggests termites evolved from within the cockroach lineage, cladistically making them cockroaches as well.

== Evolution ==
According to one hypothesis, cockroaches were an '''ancient group of insects''' that arose during the Devonian epoch. Fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern cockroaches in that they had long external ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantises, as well as modern cockroaches.[[File:Abstract cockroach.jpg|thumb]]

Greek Origins of Name: Blattodea is derived from “blatta”, the Greek word for '''cockroach'''.

== Trivia ==

* The name '''cockroach comes from the Spanish term cucaracha, which derives from the Latin blatta, “an insect that shines the light'''.” It comes from the insect order Blattodea, which also includes termites

Blaberus craniifer, Also known as the '''Death's head cockroach''' is a species of [[Blattodea|blattid]] from the genus [[Blaberus]]. 

== Etymology ==
The name death's head comes from the markings on the top of the pronotum: "cranii", which is Latin for "of the head", and "fer", meaning "carry" or "carrier." 

== Morphology ==
This speciescan reach lengths of upto 1.5 inches to more than 2 inches long and a little more than 1 inch wide.The body of the death's head cockroach is brown, though juveniles are usually speckled. The wings are mostly for show, as the death's head cockroach cannot fly. They have a flat, shell-like body, which can provide some shelter from predators. A cockroach's legs are usually referred to as jointed appendages and attach to the thorax. The appendages at the end of the abdomen are called cerci. With the cerci, roaches detect air movements, which usually cause them to run. The cerci have multiple segments but are not jointed. The antennae and tibiae are the most sensitive of the cockroach’s organs and provide assistance in locomotion. When frightened, the death’s head cockroach can emit a mild odor.They possess pink-colored flight muscles that can sustain flight for mediocre distances however they tend to glide short distances upon being threatened They have pulsating circulatory systems concealed within their antennae. Some insects are capable of regenerating certain worn-out tissues, and the most frequent type of regeneration in ''B. craniifer'' is intercalary regeneration which is a long-standing zoological dispute concerning the segmental composition of the heads of the various arthropod groups, and how they are evolutionarily related to each other. While the dispute has historically centered on the exact make-up of the insect head 

== Metamorphosis ==
Blaberus Craniifer is Holometabolic. 

=== Reproduction ===
The spermatophore is made by the male inside the females' genital atrium, which is rejected by her multiple days later due to the secretions of her spermathecal glands. Several days later, an ootheca is laid and placed by the female into her brood sac. The gestation period for ''B. craniifer'' lasts 55 to 65 days. After this period, the ootheca is ejected and the larvae free themselves from the embryonic covering. During the preoviposition period and during gestation sexual receptivity of females is inhibited.

=== Nymphal Stage ===
Females carry approximately 34 eggs in an egg case located in a pouch at the end of the abdomen. After three to four weeks, the newborns called "nymphs" hatch and make a hiding place in the ground. They sprout wing sheaths as they grow and molt. Molting involves shedding its outer shell in favor of a bigger one to accommodate its increasing size.

=== Imago ===
A cockroach will molt several times before it reaches maturity. A death's head cockroach is full grown after four to five months, and can live '''up to a year'''

== Behavior ==

=== Feeding Habits ===
Death's head cockroaches are omnivores with great appetites. They are known to eat half their weight in food at one time and will feed on feces or sometimes even on wood if necessary. They are not known to be [[Xylophagous]].

=== Defense mechanisms ===
In response to a predator approaching or after an attack, ''B. craniifer'' burrows itself into softer substrates when possible, using its head and pronotum, allowing the cockroach to hide. Cockroaches are gregarious insects, meaning they often interact and associate with one another. ''B. craniifer'' secretes a volatile aggregative pheromone from the mandibular glands when engaging in gregarious behaviour

Termitidae. It is endemic to northern Australia and the common names derive from the fact that the wedge-shaped mound is aligned with its main axis running north and south.
==Description==
A large mound may house up to a million individual termites. Each is the nest of a colony of ''Amitermes meridionalis'' and houses the queen, king, reproductives, soldiers and workers. The outer surface of the mound is hard and durable whereas the material separating the chambers and galleries inside is more papery.[2] The soldiers are 4 to 6 mm (0.16 to 0.24 in) long and their curved mandibles bear a single in-turned tooth.[1] Many termites never leave the mound and as a result of this protected environment they have thin cuticles, colorless bodies, little sight and little ability to protect themselves.
==Distribution and habitat==
''Amitermes meridionalis'' is native to the northern part of Northern Territory of Australia, around Darwin. The slab-like mounds are found in low-lying grassland areas that flood during the rainy season. The mounds are often widely scattered,[1] but may be grouped together in a graveyard-like manner.

is flashing with vibrant colors and can be seen worldwide, except Antarctica, and has a vibrant green-lustrous exoskeleton. The propagation of the light reflected depicts the colours seen by the human eye present on it's exoskeleton and appears to shine a rainbow hue under clear white light. The beautiful colors on it's exoskeleton make it an easy prey for most predators, hence it is known to release a foul-smelling odor to scare off any unappealing predators that dare approach it. They feed on sap by sucking it out of new seeds. They can become a serious pest due to these habits of feeding on plants. Study more about their behaviors and where are they native to. 

== Biology ==
Calidea dregii likes feeding on sap from newly born trees as we know it. It's physical appearance can often be mistaken for a jewel beetle, however they are considered to be from the family of insects known as [[Pentatomidae]], which compromises of stink bugs (Another term for [[Pentatomoidea|shield bugs]]). Their classification to this category is due to their defense mechanism, excretion of a foul-smelling liquid to warn predators. The most notable feature is their lustrous carapace which reflects light in such ways causing white light to divide into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet (the propagation of light affects the pattern of the colors). They can be seen thriving in semi-arid climates all over the world and most commonly seen in Southeast Asia and other parts of the hemisphere, especially India, hence their second name (green jewel bug of India) These bugs also have green blotches on their carapace and are completely orange (sometimes yellowish-pink) on their underside. They are one of the biggest pests in agriculture. It has a vibrant exoskeleton and whitish-blue legs and a joint which connects a needle-like proboscis hidden underneath the head.  

== Behavior ==
They will look for the softer part of the host plant's stem and them use it's needle-like mouth to penetrate through the venations and the stem tissues, it will then, after unhinging it's needle-like mouth part, will suck out the sap from the stem of the unfortunate host plant (it's diet includes poisonous plants as well) . This is how it feeds. This type of feeding behavior is similar to that of [[ASSASIN Insect|assasin bugs]]. Unlike Calidea dregii, assasin bugs will use a paralyzing venom to melt down the prey's tissues and cells, then suck them out alongside the innards (this hunting behavior is very common for predatory insects). Now if we talk about Calidea dregii, their behavior is just the same as other Pentatomidae species with their methods of foraging being none other than wandering as they are practically flightless and will rarely ever use their wings.  

== Habitat ==
Calidea dregii are happy under captivity if fed well enough. They prefer lychee trees and other young tree saplings. They can be seen thriving in unbelievably huge numbers in semi-arid regions of the southern hemisphere and can be seen scuttling on leaves, plants and in the soil. They prefer either slightly humid, yet not so cold, climates and are very common in Southeast Asia and can be seen in bushveld regions as it prefers weed patches of moss and overgrowth.

The '''cicadas''' (/sɪˈkɑːdə/ or /sɪˈkeɪdə/) are a superfamily, the '''Cicadoidea''', of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha,[a] along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. It is divided into the Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and Cicadidae, with more than 1,300 species described from around the world; many undescribed species remain.

Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. They have an exceptionally loud song, produced not by stridulation, but by vibrating drum-like tymbals rapidly. The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees, feeding on sap, and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic, singing at night to avoid predators. The periodic cicadas spend most of their lives as underground nymphs, emerging only after 13 or 17 years, which may reduce losses by satiating their predators.

Cicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer's Iliad, and as motifs in art from the Chinese Shang dynasty. They have been used in myths and folklore to represent carefree living and immortality. Cicadas are eaten in various countries, including China, where the nymphs are served deep-fried in Shandong cuisine.
==Etymology==
The name is a direct derivation of the Latin cicada, meaning "tree cricket". American English of central Appalachia retains the name "jarfly".[1] In ancient Greek, it was called a tettix, and in modern Greek τζιτζίκας, tzitzikas—both names being onomatopoeic.
==Taxonomy and diversity==
Cicadas are arranged into two families: the Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae. The two extant species of Tettigarctidae include one in southern Australia and the other in Tasmania. The family Cicadidae is subdivided into the subfamilies Cicadinae, Tettigadinae, and Cicadettinae;[2] they are found on all continents except Antarctica. Some previous works also included a family-level taxon called the Tibiceninae. The largest species is the Malaysian emperor cicada ''[[Megapomponia imperatorial]]''; its wingspan is up to about 20 cm (8 in).[3] They are also notable for the great length of time some species take to mature.

At least 1300 cicada species are distributed worldwide with the majority being in the tropics. Most genera are restricted to a single biogeographical region and many species have a very limited range. This high degree of endemism has been used to study the biogeography of complex island groups such as in Indonesia and the Orient.[6] There are about 200 described species in Australia and New Zealand,[c] around 150 in South Africa, over 170 in America north of Mexico,[7] at least 800 in Latin America,[8] and over 200 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific.[9] About 100 species occur in the Palaearctic. A few species are found in southern Europe,[4] and a single species is in England, the New Forest cicada, ''Melampsalta montana'', which also occurs in continental Europe.[10]

Most of the North American species are in the genus ''[[Neotibicen]]'': the annual or jar fly or dog-day cicadas (so named because they emerge in late July and August).[11] The best-known North American genus, however, is ''[[Magicicada]]''. These periodical cicadas have an extremely long lifecycle of 13 or 17 years, suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers.[11]

Australian cicadas are found on tropical islands and cold coastal beaches around Tasmania, in tropical wetlands, high and low deserts, alpine areas of New South Wales and Victoria, large cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, and Tasmanian highlands and snowfields. Many of them go by common names such as cherry nose, brown baker, red eye, greengrocer, yellow Monday, whisky drinker, double drummer, and black prince. The Australian greengrocer, ''[[Cyclochila australasiae]]'', is among the loudest insects in the world.[12]

Forty-two species from five genera populate New Zealand, ranging from sea level to mountain tops, and all are endemic to New Zealand and the surrounding islands (Norfolk Island, New Caledonia).
===Palaeontology===
Fossil Cicadomorpha first appeared in the Upper Permian.[14] The superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families. The Upper Permian Dunstaniidae are found in Australia and South Africa, and also in younger rocks from China. The Upper Triassic Mesogereonidae are found in Australia and South Africa.

The Palaeontinidae or "giant cicadas" come from the Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous of Eurasia and South America.[15] The first of these was a forewing discovered in the Taynton Limestone Formation of Oxfordshire, England; it was initially described as a butterfly in 1873, before being recognized as a cicada and renamed ''Palaeontina oolitica''.

== Morphology ==
Males are 8.9-10.5 mm long, while females are 8.2-10.5 mm they are A beautiful and charmingly tiny insect with irregular-shaped scarlet or vermillion patterns on the wings, The head along with the thoracic region are matt-black This species are often remarked over their elongated almost shield-like bodies They have a triangular mark at the base of their wings, They have a visibly clear defence mechanism, That is their Aposetismic coloration ( Technical term: Warning coloration ) They have a smoky and rough-textured wings Their hindwings are potentially transparent.  They are sometimes kept as pets.

== Geographical range ==
This species is present in most of Europe (Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Spain, the former Yugoslavia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Hungary, Great Britain and Italy

== Ecology ==

=== Seasonal History ===
Adults can be found from April to August. They are polyphagous, mainly sucking vegetable juices of grasses, but also of other plants (''Arrhenatherum elatius'', ''Dactylis glomerata'', ''Urtica dioica'', ''Filipendula ulmaria'', ''Aegopodium podagraria'', etc.), 

=== Flight ===
They can easily fly and are also equipped with very effective saltatory back legs, allowing jumps of up to 70 centimeters. They can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond to execute a jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.

== Metamorphosis ==
When they mate ''Cercopis'' male and female stay side by side with an angle of less than 45°. The female lays eggs at the end of summer in plants and trees that overwinter. Larvae live underground on the roots of various plants, inside a typical foam nest, that protects them from dehydration and against enemies. The nymph sucks vegetable juices out of the roots of the host plants. The nymph comes up in spring.

Orchid mantis}}

to be the largest to mimic flowers. 

== Morphology ==
Females grow to be about 13 centimetres (about 5 inches) in length and males to about 10 centimetres (about 4 inches). They are native to Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Somalia, Tanzania, and Uganda. Its threat display is magnificently colored, with red, white, blue, purple and black. The head of ''I. diabolica'' contains three vital components: compound eyes, antennae, and mandibles. The compound eyes, composed of thousands of individual photoreceptor cells, enable good eyesight. The arrangement of photoreceptor units, for instance, allows the insect to capture a perceptual span of 180°. This allows ''I. diabolica'' to identify prey and predators without increasing its vulnerability by spoiling its camouflage. The antennae, a pair of long and thin bristles, serve as the insect's sensory perception. Projecting outwards, the antennae can detect much in the surrounding environment such as chemicals, movement, and odors. The male antennae are more developed than those of the females and are feather-like. This allows them to track down females by detecting the pheromones released by the females. These pheromones notify the males that the females are ready to reproduce. The mandibles can be used to "tear, puncture, or grind" food. he thorax constitutes a large portion of the insect's body. As in all insects, it is composed of three segments: the prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax. Each section "contains one pair of legs, however, the wings are found only on the mesothoracic and metathoracic segments. Reproductive organs, respiratory organs, and other organ systems occupy the abdominal region of the insect.

== Behavior ==

=== Defense mechanism ===
When confronted by a predator, ''I. diabolica'' initiates a deimatic display in an attempt "to scare off or momentarily distract a predator". Its front legs, specifically the femora, are raised to expose the conspicuous patterns depicted on the bottom of the thorax and abdomen. Similarly, the wings display a combination of vibrant colours. Observational analysis of ''I. diabolica'' in captive settings revealed an additional tactic of shifting its wings left to right to startle and confuse predators. 

=== Predatory Habits ===
In the presence of prey, ''I. diabolica'', impersonating a flower, remains motionless. Its objective is to seduce the insect into its striking zone. In this zone, ''Idolomantis diabolica'' uses the tibiae of its legs to grasp and maintain a strong grip on the prey. The mandibles are then "wielded as formidable weapons" to decapitate and devour the prey. The dietary preference of ''I. diabolica'' is exclusively airborne insects, specifically flies, moths, butterflies and beetles.

== Life cycle ==
[[File:Idolomantis.jpg|thumb]]
A female deposits some 10 to 50 eggs in an ootheca. The period between egg-laying and hatching varies according to temperature and humidity, but about fifty days would be typical. After hatching, the nymphs feed on small insects such as houseflies and fruit flies. Males develop into adults after undergoing ecdysis about seven times into successive instars, while females mature after about eight instars. The lifespan of ''I. diabolica'' varies according to the habitat, but is typically about 12 months.

== Care as a pet ==
Due to its beauty and dramatic displays, the devil's flower mantis is considered a prestigious pet. Consumers, specifically in the Western Hemisphere, purchase thousands on a yearly basis, this is indeed true that mantids are exquisitely gorgeous pets and require low maintenance, they are pretty and easy to take care of although they may not be a good [[Insects as pets|pet]] being for being a friend with, all you need for having one is a terrarium either square or rectangular in shape it is recommended using old unwanted terrariums, aquariums, fishbowls or you can purchase one, to make one all you need is some wooden planks, a measuring tape and most importantly a glass planes in order to see the pet orchid mantis, the price for a homemade terrarium is relatively low and quite easy to make. Devil mantids need an atmosphere closely similar to their original habitat please be gentle while handling it as any possible wounds can lead to bacterial infections and are very gentle. They are an Ideal choice as a pet if you prefer silent pets. Add in more plants to your terrarium, add pebbles rocks, old timber wood and other ornamental objects Ideal as an addition to the terrarium, large creatures especially lepidopteran prey are the core part of it's diet Mealworms can be fed twice or thrice in a week as they are high in fat or you can feed them with small beetles, leafhoppers, moths and butterflies (More often) and that is all you need to know before keeping one.

'''Mantises''' are an order of insects that contains over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 30 families. The largest family is the [[Mantids|Mantidae]]. Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks.

== Morphology ==
Mantises have large, triangular heads with a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, and a pair of antennae. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180°. The mantis thorax consists of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus ''Mantoida'', the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer than the other two thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile. 

== Behavior ==
The closest relatives of mantises are termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other unrelated insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). 

=== Hunting mechanism ===
Mantises are generalist predators of arthropods. The majority of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within their reach. They either camouflage themselves and remain stationary, waiting for prey to approach, or stalk their prey with slow, stealthy movements. Larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals of their own species, as well as small vertebrates such as lizards, frogs, fish, and particularly small birds.

=== Defense mechanism ===
Mantises are preyed on by vertebrates such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders, large species of hornets, and ants. Some hunting wasps, such as some species of ''Tachytes'' also paralyse some species of mantis to feed their young. Generally, mantises protect themselves by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey. Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened so as to eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence. 

== Metamorphosis ==
The adult female praying mantis lays 100 to 400 eggs after fertilization. The eggs are laid safely on a firm leaf or stem with a liquid that hardens to be a protective sac structure known as ootheca. Initially, the hatched nymphs stay around the egg casing for a while. It's during this period that the mantis try to feed on each other. After spreading out, they will begin to hunt for small insects such as fruit flies. Adolescent mantises are larger in size than nymphs. They shed their exoskeletons occasionally, a feature that differentiates them from adult mantises. Mantises tend to be sluggish before they molt and will rarely feed during this period. Full-grown mantises are normally between 1 to 6 inches in length, and are different in size depending on their species. Female mantises can be distinguished from males as they have heavier abdomens.
